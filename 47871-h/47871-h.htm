<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>This biography of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> James Geikie is based upon
his own letters, papers, and diaries, and upon information
supplied by many of those who were closely
associated with him, both during his earlier days on
the Geological Survey and the later in Edinburgh.
Much of the material was sorted and arranged by
Mrs Geikie before it was placed in my hands, and to
her I am indebted for many notes, memoranda, and
verbal statements which supplemented the documents
supplied. Mrs Geikie had herself composed, for the
use of the family, a brief account of her husband’s
early days, and on this manuscript the first chapter
is largely based; without its aid the composition of
that chapter would have been very difficult.</p>

<p>For later years I am under great obligations to
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s many friends and correspondents, at
home and abroad. Correspondents across the seas,
especially, deserve warm thanks for their willingness
to trust valuable original documents to the post, at
a time when the phrase “perils of the sea” had
taken on a new meaning. It is satisfactory to be
able to state that in no case was such material lost
as a result of hostile action. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Stevenson of
New York and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Chamberlin of Chicago must be
specially mentioned as having supplied much material.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
It should perhaps be added that the circumstances
under which the book was written made it impossible
to obtain letters or information from many continental
geologists, who, in happier times, would doubtless
have been glad to render assistance.</p>

<p>A large amount of material was also kindly
supplied by geologists and others in this country.
Among those who have taken a keen interest in the
progress of the work, and have rendered notable
assistance, mention may be made of the following
friends and correspondents of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie:&mdash;Dr
John Horne, who supplied many letters and much
detailed information&mdash;to his kindly and unfailing help
this memoir of his old friend owes much; Dr Peach,
whose accounts of early days on the Survey were
most helpful; Mr Lionel Hinxman, Mr H. M. Cadell,
and many others, to whom application was made in
regard to matters of detail. Among the last mention
may be made of Dr W. B. Blaikie of Messrs T. &amp; A.
Constable, Mr T. S. Muir of the Royal High
School, and Mr John Grossart. To all who have
rendered assistance I desire to offer most cordial
thanks, and trust that they and others will feel that
the biographical sketch, in however imperfect a
fashion, does present a lifelike picture of one who
rarely failed to inspire affection and admiration in
those who came to close quarters with him.</p>

CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="sub_head"><span class="smcap">Boyhood and Youth</span><br />

1839&ndash;1861</span></h2>


<p>James Geikie was born on 23rd August 1839, in
a house in Edinburgh which was later pulled down
to make room for the University Union. He was
the third son and the third child in a family of eight,
consisting of five sons and three daughters, and was
baptised as James Murdoch Geikie. He abolished&mdash;to
use his own word&mdash;the Murdoch in boyhood.</p>

<p>His father was in business in Edinburgh, but
by taste and inclination was a musician, and in later
years, after retiring from business, devoted himself
entirely to music, and was the author of a number
of compositions, sacred and secular. A little anecdote,
recalled by his son in later years, suggests that it
had always been his ambition to be a professional
musician, and that he had been thwarted in youth.
The story relates that one day he said to James somewhat
sadly:&mdash;“If ever you have a son who wants to
make music his profession, do not oppose his wish.”
In the fulness of time, it is interesting to note, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of James Geikie’s sons did express this desire, and
his father scrupulously observed the injunction of
the long-dead grandfather. The point is not without
importance, from more than one aspect, and is at
least a partial refutation of the pessimists who, like
Samuel Butler, maintain that each generation repeats
the mistakes of the last in dealing with youth.</p>

<p>Another artistic strain in the family was represented
in the person of Walter Geikie, an uncle,
who was a well-known painter of Scotch scenes
and left also some good etchings. Of him James
Geikie, in an undated fragment of what was
apparently intended to be a history of the family,
says:&mdash;“Of my Uncle Walter I will say nothing:
the Life prefixed to his etchings having already
forestalled anything I could tell. He was a capital
mimic and possessed of boundless good nature.
Had he been longer spared he might well have
become famous in his profession, but Death, to
whom the genius and the numbskull are one and
the same, carried him off in the year 1837&mdash;two
years before I was born.” James, it may be noted
here, had himself considerable skill as a draughtsman,
as both his published works and his geological note-books
show clearly, which adds interest to this note
upon his artist uncle. Another uncle, who was
a minister and went out to the United States when
James was young, was the father of Cunningham
Geikie the divine, author of a widely-read <cite>Life of
Christ</cite>.</p>

<p>The latter lived with the Geikie family in
Edinburgh for some time in his student days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
The <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> from which the above quotation is
made, which is annotated in pencil by its author,
is, as stated, a mere fragment and undated. Internal
evidence, however, suggests that it may have been
written about 1856, the writing and composition
recalling some extant letters of this period, and it
shows, as further quotations will indicate, that its
author, with all his obvious immaturity, was even then
feeling after a style.</p>

<p>James Geikie’s mother was a Miss Thom, a
daughter of a merchant captain, who was born
in Inverness but established himself at Dunbar.
Here he married the daughter of a local shipbuilder,
whose family was connected by marriage&mdash;to quote
again the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> already mentioned&mdash;with “that
Roderick MacKenzie who suffered his head to be
taken from him that he might save that of Prince
Charles Stewart”; a fact of which the boy James
confesses himself very proud. In his later days
Captain Thom often visited his married daughter,
and the important part which he played in developing
the imagination of the children is suggested in the
following sentences (from <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr>):&mdash;“My Grandfather
Thom when I first knew him had not ceased to
plough the sea for his living. He was of a middle
stature, well-made, and muscular. I can still see
his fine head nearly bald&mdash;what hair he had was
of a beautiful silver white&mdash;his Roman nose. I
can still at this late period follow him in his walks.
I see him sitting with his old cronies&mdash;relics of fights
by land and sea&mdash;on that seat between the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
old trees&mdash;long since pulled down to make way
for those improvements, so-called, which have altered
entirely what in my young days went by the name
of ‘The Meadows.’ His stories of adventures with
the robbers of the sea are rife in my memory. His
voyages to places whose very names smack of fairy-land&mdash;his
hairbreadth escapes&mdash;his deeds of daring&mdash;the
recollection of all these rises vividly before me
at the mere mention of his name. I looked upon
him as another Sinbad&mdash;a second Robinson Crusoe;
and my acquaintance with his queer old friends
served to heighten the romantic colours in which
I viewed him! Alas! all these school-boy dreamings
are past; but they will sometimes flit before me as I
lie gazing up into the deep blue of a summer sky,
recalling the old days which have gone away into
dim forgetfulness: and they will sometimes come
again as I sit alone musing by the winter fireside.
Verily there is a something&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;about
the past which renders it infinitely more endearing
to us than all the brightest dreams of the future.”</p>

<p>The only comment which it is necessary to make
upon the above is to repeat that it was apparently
written when the boy was about seventeen, and thus,
as we shall see, at a period when he was engaged in
uncongenial work, and when his future was uncertain:
these facts help to explain what the James Geikie of
a later day would have contemptuously denounced as
the “high-falutin” style.</p>

<p>In addition to the visits of Captain Thom to
Edinburgh, family intercourse was kept up by return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
visits of the children to Dunbar, where the ships
appealed strongly to the imagination of James. He
was fond of saying in later years that he used to
watch them dipping below the horizon and longed
to follow them to see what lay beyond; and the
<i>Wanderlust</i>, so early developed, lasted till the end of
life. In a letter to one of his sons, written to Egypt
in 1901, he says:&mdash;“Old man tho’ I am, I’m just as
keen to knock about the world as ever I was. It
is like renewing my youth even to think about it!”</p>

<p>In connection with the seafarer’s blood which
he inherited from his mother’s side, it is also of
interest to note that James was an excellent traveller
both by sea and land; the sea had no terrors for him,
and his voyages were a source of continuous pleasure,
both at the time and in recollection.</p>

<p>As to his immediate intellectual heritage, it seems
probable that James took the majority of his qualities
from his father’s side. But his mother, of whom he was
very fond, was a woman of great ability and much
ambition for her clever sons, whom she spurred on
in their careers. Her extraordinary skill as a needlewoman,
and her capacity for hard work, are enshrined
in the family traditions, and it is probable that James
took from her his remarkable perseverance and his
manual dexterity. The father was full of <i>bonhomie</i>,
probably as deeply impregnated as his son with the
<i>joie de vivre</i>, and like him more desirous of a full
life than given to the narrow concentration which
achieves a particular purpose at the expense of so
much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
From his father James seems to have inherited
his imagination and the touch of constructive genius
which enabled him to do such noteworthy work;
but one can well believe that the instinct which
led the son to interleave his scientific observations in
his geological note-books with verses, prevented the
father from devoting himself as whole-heartedly to
the pursuit of worldly prosperity as his wife may have
thought desirable in view of the large and growing
family.</p>

<p>It is at least certain that money was not very
abundant in the early days, though the house contained
many books, and there seems to have been
much music and liveliness, the father, like the son,
being a capital story-teller. He must also have been
a traveller in his day, for James in a letter to his
brother William speaks of him as going off to the
Continent in 1858, a much rarer adventure for a man
of moderate means then than now. The occasion was
a musical festival at Bonn, and was apparently taken
advantage of to the full, the tour being extended
to Paris and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Details in regard to the early life of James Geikie
are scanty. These were days long before the time
when conscientious parents recorded in neatly kept
note-books all details as to the growth and development
of their offspring; while with babies following
each other at regular intervals throughout a long
period of years, the mother had probably little time
to put on record any signs of precocity in the elder
boys, if such existed. Two little stories, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
emphasise the statements made above as to the effect
on the children’s imagination of Captain Thom’s
yarns. When very small James, in company with his
brother William, who was two years older, set off
to walk down to Joppa, some three and a half miles
from Edinburgh, to see the world, and incidentally to
visit an aunt who lived in the district. The two
arrived very tired, only, after a meal and a rest, to be
ignominiously taken home again by their aunt. In
those days communications between the shore and
the city were difficult, and the party had to trudge
back on foot, the small James, whose ambition on
this occasion had somewhat outrun his strength,
having to be carried most of the way.</p>

<p>But this inglorious finale did not quench the
ardour of the youthful pair, who were probably slow
to grasp the attitude of grown-up people towards
displays of initiative on the part of the young. Next
time they planned to make a voyage on their own
account, and to place the water between them and
over-zealous family affection. They were so far
successful as to reach Leith and find their way on
board a ship. But alas! even here they were met by
a display of the adult passion for interference, and
were taken home by a sailor who, regardless of the
soul within, maintained that their diminutive stature
debarred them from seeking life and adventure on the
high seas. As one of the grandfather’s most popular
stories related how he had sunk a pirate boat in the
Bay of Naples, by means of a small gun loaded with
scrap iron, and how in consequence he had been fêted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
by the Neapolitans, and had had his portrait painted,
one can imagine that the brothers were very bitter at
this second check to their own ambitions. James
had to wait many years before he faced Italian
pirates and brigands, and then it was the milder
variety which requires to be treated with another
metal rather than iron, and cannot be disposed of
by Captain Thom’s summary methods.</p>

<p>Another story of childhood is interesting because
it shows how completely the boy was the father of the
man. At some unknown but early date he had
a serious illness. So desperate seemed his condition
that the doctor, speaking in the presence of the
apparently unconscious boy, permitted himself to tell
the mother that recovery was practically impossible,
and was not to be desired, as the child would be
feeble-minded. After the doctor had left, the poor
mother came back into the room crying, but little
Jamie found strength to whisper feebly: <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">“I’ll no
dee yet, mother.”</span></p>

<p>Long years afterwards, in a bad illness some four
or five years before his death, somewhat similar
incidents happened. One day after he had seen the
doctor exchange a grave glance with the nurse, he
managed, after the doctor had left the room, to say:
“Tell him I have a return ticket.” On another
occasion one sick-room attendant volunteered to
another the statement that she did not think the
professor would last till the morning, and was
considerably startled to hear the apparently dying
man, who was lying with his eyes closed, say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
distinctly, if feebly, “The professor will last till the
morning, and he’ll last till he sees you out of the
house.” Needless to say he did more than this, for
he lived to tell the tale with his old glee and vivacity.
Perhaps the medical science of a later date will be
able to find an explanation of this power of resistance,
and of its association with the nervous temperament
rather than with strong physique. Meantime it is
interesting to have another confirmation of the
frequent experience that in a death-struggle, whether
with internal or external foes, the “muscular Christian”
can often give a less good account of himself than the
nervous one. The boy, who if he lived was to be
feeble-minded, not only lived but added notably to
the world’s stock of knowledge.</p>

<p>Only one early letter has been preserved, and it
gives no clue as to its date, beyond the fact that it
is printed in childish capitals, which are, however,
wonderfully straight, and shows an uncharacteristic
uncertainty as to spelling. It reads:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Father and Mother</span>,&mdash;We are very much disappointed,
at youre not leaving London on Saturday. We hopet to have the
pleasure of seeing you pull down the pears for us but since you have
not come, we will have to bigin ourselves and take them down.
We are all in good health we wer all up at the castle with Thom
to day and saw Mons Meg. Write us soon and let us know when
yoo ar really to leave.&mdash;Your affectionate son,</p>

<p class="signed smcap">James M. Geikie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>James Geikie’s early education was obtained at
a private school, where he seems to have been
unhappy. The master was brutal in his methods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and ill-suited to have charge of a delicate, nervous
boy. The climax came when one day he approached
James from behind, and seized his ear roughly
between his finger and thumb, giving it a painful
wrench. The boy, maddened with pain and fright,
sprang up, and seizing the nearest object, which
happened to be an inkpot, flung it at his assailant.
He then made for the door, his exit closing one
educational chapter. Afterwards, in 1850, when he
was eleven years of age, he went to Edinburgh High
School, then under the rectorship of Dr Schmitz.
Here James Geikie seems to have distinguished
himself chiefly in classics. The classical master was
Dr Boyd, who evidently perceived his abilities, for he
told him that he expected to hear of him in later
years either as a poet or as a literary man.</p>

<p>Under Dr Boyd James Geikie gained a prize for
a translation from Virgil into English verse, and his
knack of verse-making seems to have been carefully
fostered. A number of his verse translations have
been preserved, some written out in his brother
William’s extraordinarily neat hand, others printed
by James himself at a later date.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, it would seem as though
the education of the boys was carried out more
outside school than in it. In those days Scottish
schools were unaffected by English traditions in the
matter of sport. There were no organised games,
and the boys obtained exercise in whatever way
pleased them best. The Geikie children kept many
pets in their garden, and James’s considerable manual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
dexterity was often called upon in connection with the
welfare of these. A family tradition led the children
to give those of their pets who died before their time
an elaborate funeral, and James’s skill in coffin-making
is still lauded by the remaining members
of his family.</p>

<p>Of more importance for his future career were
the long excursions by which the boys as they grew
satisfied their <i>Wanderlust</i>. Edinburgh is, of course,
even to-day singularly favoured by Nature in the
number and variety of the possible excursions within
easy reach of the town, and in those days conditions
were still better. In later years, when he took his
geological students over Arthur’s Seat, James Geikie
used often to lament what he regarded as the spoiling
of that park by the construction of roads, which for
him took away the feeling of wildness, and part of
the impressiveness of the wonderful volcanic scenery.
He did not live to see a further stage in which the
citizens were shut off by the exigencies of war from
the enjoyment of the most attractive part of the park.</p>

<p>A little anecdote that he often also told on his
excursions is not without interest. As a boy he was
lying on the hill one day reading a book when he was
accosted by a party consisting of a tall gentleman,
a little lady, and a group of children. The gentleman
asked the way to the top of the hill, and James not
only volunteered to guide them, but ultimately carried
the smallest girl pickaback up part of the climb.
The party had a pleasant stroll, and parted the best
of friends. As the boy came down the slopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
towards Holyrood, however, he found a considerable
crowd waiting, and learnt that his help had been
asked by the Prince Consort, that the lady was
Queen Victoria, and the little girl he had carried
the Princess Alice.</p>

<p>One motive for the long holiday rambles seems
to have been butterfly-collecting, if one may judge
from the enthusiasm with which in later years, when
himself the father of growing boys, he entered into
the pursuit for their sakes. Some of his letters
written to his sons during his travels on the Continent
and in America are thoroughly boy-like in their
enthusiasm for the beautiful creatures, and in their
descriptions of the efforts necessary to obtain perfect
specimens. But like many an Edinburgh boy before
and since, he was keenly interested in fossils and in
the rocks and minerals represented in the neighbourhood
of his native town. Fossil-hunting expeditions
to the famous limestone quarries of Burdiehouse and
Gilmerton, and to the coprolitic shales down on the
shore at Wardie, were often undertaken in company
with two future colleagues on the Geological Survey&mdash;his
eldest brother Archibald, later Director of the
Geological Survey, and now Sir Archibald Geikie,
and the boy who afterwards became <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> John
Young of Glasgow. James was considerably younger
than either, and, as he himself indicates in a Memoir
prefixed to Dr Young’s <cite>Essays and Addresses</cite> (1904),
was only allowed to accompany his seniors occasionally
and as a special favour. Indeed, throughout all
this early period it seems clear that “Jamie” was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
only a little boy, not of great account in a family
whose hopes were concentrated on the eldest son.
The latter seems to have settled his own career early,
for it is recorded that one day while walking up the
South Bridge with his little brother, he said:&mdash;“Do
you see that big building with the iron gates? I am
going in there, and one day I shall be a professor
there.” The little brother’s feelings at the time are
not recorded, but it seems probable that no one in
the family contemplated that the great iron gates
would open for him also as a professor.</p>

<p>With two older brothers, and two more following
after, it is not to be wondered at that James Geikie’s
school-days soon ended. In 1853 he left the High
School, and at the beginning of 1854 was apprenticed
to Mr Thomas Constable, the printer. His life here
does not seem to have been happy. The confinement
and long hours did not suit his health, the occupation
did not appeal to his tastes, and among his chief
consolations seem to have been occasional geologising
holidays and books. These he read on his way to
and from his work, for the family by this time lived
on the other side of what, despite the past tense of
the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> quoted on <a href="#Page_6" title="Page 6"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 6</a>, is still called The Meadows,
and this open space had to be crossed daily.</p>

<p>In October 1855, however, his brother Archibald
joined the Geological Survey, and this, which opened
a possible avenue of escape for James, then only
sixteen, marked an important turning-point in his
career. Of the period as printer it is only necessary
to add that, much as he disliked it at the time, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
fond of saying in later years that it was a useful
experience, for it gave him a knowledge of the routine
of printing work which stood him in good stead in
his own constant proof-reading.</p>

<p>He stayed at Constable’s till the summer of
1858, and some letters to his brother William have
been preserved which give interesting glimpses of his
character in this period of drudgery and development.
William had gone out to relatives of the family in the
United States, and the letters were written to him
there. His death, it may be noted, took place as the
result of an accident, shortly after the date of the last
of the letters. Some extracts from them may be
quoted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
<span class="smcap">Hope Park</span>, <i>31st <abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 1856</i>.
</p>

<p>I have met with very little in my daily routine, since I went to
Constable’s, that could entertain you, and will therefore skip over
my past years and come to the <i lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">pint</i>, as Cousin Archie used to say.
When you left you’ll remember I was still <i lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">daidlin’ mong drudgery</i>.
I had to do so for a good while after that, till so it chanced I was
<em>promoted</em> to a <em>frame</em>. I got on pretty well, considering the long
hours, and badly ventilated room, which were playing the very
mischief with my health, so I hung on (if you’ll excuse the expression)
until summer had come with its usual slackness in trade, and
then I got rest. But summer, alas! like everything beneath the
sun, is perishable, and so the crows’ nests began to peer through
the thinly clad trees once more, and autumn coming sighing and
weeping, but bringing with her, as her recompense and consolation,
the richly laden field and the clear cloudless moon.... Well I
went back to the office, and winter, and spring, and summer and
autumn passed away, and “the new year’s coming up” (of which I
wish you and all the <em>natives</em> very many happy returns), and here I am
at home away from the office again. The late hours (9 to 10) have
knocked me <em>up</em> (or, as you are a bit of a Yankee, “<em>down</em>” if you
like) and I have got leave for a week or two, which I intend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>spending with Archie. He, the Professor, delivered a lecture at
Penicuik the other day on the “<i>Geology of the District</i>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
<i><abbr title="August">Aug.</abbr> 1858.</i>
</p>

<p>I am home at present on the sick list, and it is not likely I’ll be
back to office before the end of autumn. We have glorious weather
here at present,&mdash;and if I go to the country I have not the slightest
doubt but I’ll enjoy myself. B&mdash;&mdash;’s master has failed; but the
General is not as yet out of his employment altho’ he expects soon
to be so. I wish I were out of mine; I verily believe it will land
me in a premature grave. It never has agreed with me.</p>

<p>Mother is anxious to go off to the country with me. We are
just looking about for a place. Perhaps Melrose or Lanark, but
lodgings in both places are dear. I go at any rate with Archie next
month to Fife; to be located probably at Aberdour; where I will
be able to prosecute my geological studies, for I hope, if I am spared,
to be able to join the Survey.&mdash;My dear Willie I will now close.
I never forget you nor ever shall. You become all the dearer the
further and longer you are away. God grant that we meet again on
earth, if not we are always sure of meeting in a far better place.&mdash;I
am your <abbr title="affectionate">affect.</abbr> brother,</p>

<p class="signed smcap">Jamie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gloomy prognostication that his work at the
printer’s office would land him in a premature grave
was not fulfilled, but the statement helps to explain
why he left the work in the same year as that in
which the letter was written, having apparently never
returned to the office after writing it. In order to
leave he broke his apprenticeship, and this was
strongly opposed by his employer, who told him that
a man who changed his profession would never
succeed, a prophecy&mdash;in any case somewhat extreme&mdash;which
was not fulfilled in this case.</p>

<p>But after leaving the printing-works there was
still another interval of waiting before the boy settled
down to his life-work, and found his vocation. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
did not finally enter the Survey till October 1861, a
few months after his lifelong friend Dr Young. The
period of waiting was spent partly at the University,
where he attended among other classes <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Allman’s
natural history course, a subject with which geology
was then united. He was also in a lawyer’s office for
a time, while waiting for a vacancy on the Geological
Survey.</p>

<p>To enter this he had to pass what was called a
“Qualifying Examination,” which then included what
the profane called Civil Service “tots.” These were
long sums in compound addition, which had to be
done within a limited time and with great accuracy.
Though the operation became more or less mechanical
to those who practised it assiduously, it presented
considerable difficulties to those who were not
accustomed to such work, especially when, like James
Geikie, the victim had not what are called “business”
instincts. The difficulties were, however, overcome,
and in October 1861, as already stated, he entered
the Geological Survey, forming a member of the small
Scottish staff, which consisted of Messrs H. H.
Howell, Archibald Geikie, Dr Young, and himself,
with the addition, a few months later, of Mr (now Dr)
B. N. Peach. Of this band only Sir Archibald Geikie
and Dr Peach now survive.</p>

<p>With this appointment to the Survey the period
of uncertainty and waiting ended, and James Geikie,
at the age of twenty-two, entered on his life-work, and
henceforth found his way clear before him.</p>

<h2 class="chapter" title="Chapter 2. First Years on the Geological Survey">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="sub_head"><span class="smcap">First Years on the Geological Survey</span><br />

1862&ndash;1864</span></h2>


<p>James Geikie was connected with the Geological
Survey for a period of twenty years, for he only
gave up the work, with great reluctance, on his
appointment to the Murchison Chair of Geology in
the University of Edinburgh in the year 1881. It
seems only fitting, therefore, that some general
account of his life while a member of its staff should
precede any detailed description of the occupations
of the successive years. The Survey years were
singularly happy ones, were perhaps the most fruitful
in original work, and definitely determined the whole
future course of his life.</p>

<p>From the official standpoint the tale of events is
soon told. In 1861 he was appointed Assistant
Geologist. Six years later, when for the first time
the Scottish Survey was organised as a branch
separate from the English one, he was made one of
the two geologists of the staff. Two years later,
that is in 1869, he was promoted to be District
Surveyor, which made him second in position after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the Director, who was then his brother Archibald.
The post of District Surveyor he held till 1881,
when the posts of Director and the Professorship
at Edinburgh became simultaneously vacant by
the promotion of his brother. It was intimated that
the two appointments would not again be combined,
and, though as stated with great reluctance, James
gave up the Survey to take the Chair.</p>

<p>Of great interest in its effect upon his future
work was a change in the policy of the Survey
which practically synchronised with his appointment.
Previous to this time, the loose superficial deposits in
Scotland had been ignored by the surveyors, who
confined themselves to mapping the solid geology,
<i>i.e.</i>, the actual rocks, which in many parts of
Scotland are mantled by a thick covering of drift
or peat. It was decided, chiefly on economic grounds,
especially in connection with agriculture, that not
only should these superficial deposits be in future
mapped along with the solid geology, but that the
areas already surveyed should be re-mapped, with
the object of adding the omitted beds. As already
stated, Dr Young and James Geikie joined the
Survey in 1861, and Mr Peach at the beginning
of 1862. All three soon after their appointment
were entrusted with this work in Fife and the
Lothians, which had already had their solid geology
mapped. It was a kind of mapping which could be
done with considerable rapidity, and therefore involved
frequent changes of quarters. Thus, as <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie
says in the account already mentioned, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
contributed to the Memoir attached to <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Young’s
<cite>Essays and Addresses</cite>, “in a year or so we [Young
and himself] had tramped carefully over the major
portion of Fife and the Lothians.”</p>

<p>For all three novices this introductory period
seems to have left delightful recollections. In the
Memoir already quoted, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie says:&mdash;“Those
were halcyon days, and I am sure Young enjoyed
them to the full. Often in subsequent years, after
he had finally settled in Glasgow, he would recur to
them, recalling with delight old scenes and old faces
which he and I had known together. The life of
a field-geologist is, from many points of view, an
enviable one, and could youth and strength endure,
one might well be content to follow it to the end.”</p>

<p>Though spoken but of one member of the trio,
one may suspect that the statements had a wider
application. In the case of James Geikie, but recently
liberated from distasteful drudgery, having changed
a life of close confinement for the open air which
he loved, with reasonable prospects for the future
opening out before him, it would have been strange
if the “premature grave” of the letters of a few
years’ earlier date had not disappeared into the
background, and life become suddenly a great good,
for youth and strength were both there, as yet
untouched by time.</p>

<p>Though the three new members of the Survey
were all engaged on the same kind of work, it must
not be supposed that their work was done in common.
Each had his particular task assigned to him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
though they often met, sometimes indeed lodged
together, as was the case, for example, with Young
and Geikie at Peebles in the early part of 1863, and
Peach and Geikie in the spring of 1864, it was only
their leisure hours which were spent in each other’s
company. One may, without incurring the reproach
of cynicism, suspect that this greatly increased the
joys of companionship. If they had worked together,
or even in couples, the inevitable rubs and difficulties
of daily work, however congenial, might have checked
exuberant intercourse. But meeting as they did when
the day’s work was over, or only at intervals, with
the tie of common interests, with many experiences
to hear and to tell, the companionship became one of
the great joys of life.</p>

<p>The brief account in the Memoir of Young is
impregnated through and through with the recollection
of this gladness of comradeship, and a few more
phrases may be quoted to emphasise the point still
further:&mdash;“Seated by a cosy peat fire, enveloped in
clouds of tobacco smoke, confabulating, discussing,
speculating, laughing over quaint scenes and droll
experiences, life (if we had only known it!) had not
much better to give.” We read also of the wine of
life, and can feel that the writer of the account, who
was then a man of sixty-five, could, despite the forty
odd years which lay between, still feel its flavour
upon his palate as he wrote. Some of the jokes and
quips and tales of those old days have become
Survey property, transmitted by word of mouth
from generation to generation, forming part of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
invisible strand which binds together the members
of an organised body, so that while the individuals
come and go, are separated by the seven seas, by life
and by death, the spirit remains. For each individual
in turn youth goes and strength decays, but something
remains; and if in their dumb northern fashion the
individuals in this case generally passed away without
leaving enshrined either in art or in the written word
a direct record of all they felt and did, it may yet
not be amiss to indicate the enthusiasm, the devotion,
and the joy that went to the making and colouring
of those maps, and were embodied in those formal
records.</p>

<p>But the immediate purpose here is only to suggest
that those early days were for James Geikie a conscious
escape from prison, a conscious means of
self-realisation, and that it was probably the accident
that his first official field-work was given to the
drifts which determined the trend of his future
scientific work. He states, it is true, in a short
account of his career which appears in the <cite>Geological
Magazine</cite> for June 1913, that his interest in the
superficial formations, especially boulder-clay and the
associated gravels and sands, dated from his school-days.
One may well believe that, like many another
born in a region where the till is abundant, he early
succumbed to the fascination of that untidy but
delightful occupation of digging stones out of the
tenacious clay with nature’s weapons, washing them
in the nearest stream, and then following with loving
finger-tip those scratches and striations which bear so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
romantic a message. Like many others he doubtless
pressed the cherished pebbles against his cheek, and
verified practically, long years before he wrote it
down in a printed book, the statement that they are
smoothed and polished. Like many another also
he probably early got into trouble for transferring
in the course of his investigations more of the
sticky tenacious deposit to his garments than was
good for them, and was often under the sad necessity
of discarding a proportion of the much-loved and
much-fingered witnesses of an earlier age, because
their abundance made the collection grow with
unreasonable rapidity. But there is reason to believe
that his early interest in the rocks was not confined
to glacial phenomena, but was disseminated among a
variety of geological subjects; and it seems probable
that the concentration of attention, throughout long
years, on the Ice Age was largely due to the effect
of his first work on the Survey, and to the flood
of pleasurable emotion with which that work was
accompanied.</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that his work, even
in the early years, was confined to the mapping
of the superficial deposits. So early as 1863 he was
already doing solid geology, and thereafter went on
with the mapping of solid and superficial deposits
at the same time. But while he did much good work
quite apart from glacial questions, and was interested
in many kinds of geological problems, it was the
history of the Ice Cap of Europe which especially
appealed to him. His holidays&mdash;brief in early days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>&mdash;were
devoted to the study of glacial phenomena
outside his own region. His leisure hours, spent
by some of his colleagues in fishing or other forms
of sport, or in visiting, were largely devoted to
keeping himself abreast of the literature of the
subject; and this was also one of the motives which
led him to study languages so assiduously, with the
result that he was able to make first-hand acquaintance
with the papers of all the continental geologists who
wrote on his own subject.</p>

<p>If, however, throughout his long life his geological
first love commanded his unswerving devotion, it
was not because the charms of other paths did not
appeal to him. Some of the letters speak of an
ardent desire, apparently never gratified, to deal
thoroughly with Carboniferous problems, to which his
attention was drawn during his prolonged and toilsome
mapping of the Lanarkshire coalfield; and in an
interesting letter to the writer, which dates from
the early part of 1909, he speaks of other questions
which had also always attracted him. Some passages
from this letter may be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Curious how the revision of old charts of the Mediterranean
have re-awakened my interest in the structure of that basin or series
of basins! At one time I had a notion of writing a detailed memoir
on the subject, but I found it would be necessary to visit many
parts of the Mediterranean coast-lands which I had not seen and to
revisit other parts which I had looked at. I still think there is
much interesting work awaiting investigation there&mdash;the Italian
geologists seem to me to have missed the meaning of some of the
evidence which their own maps supply! If I were only twenty
years younger I believe I should start off at once&mdash;that bothering
glacial work quite drew me away from the Mediterranean problems.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Now there is no hope for me, unless on the other side of time
I may be permitted to resume investigations. In that case I shall
be independent of railways, steamboats, and even motor cars,
while I presume no hotel accommodation will be required. Perhaps
by means of telepathy I may be able to communicate results to you
as Editor of the Magazine. Unfortunately, however, it would seem
from the records of the Psychical Society, that when one becomes
disembodied and is interviewed by his bereaved and sorrowing
friends he is invariably found to have become little better than
a drivelling idiot, having lost any sense he may at one time have
possessed. Instead of enlightening you on the origin of the
Mediterranean, I may be anxious rather to get you to inform my
wife where she will find the discharged account of some nefarious
tradesman who is dunning her for a sum of 2<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> which I
had already paid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The letter shows that he realised what his devotion
had cost him; but when we reflect not only upon
what he himself accomplished but on the extraordinary
stimulus which his conclusions, some of
which were at first fiercely criticised, gave to the
investigation of glacial problems by others, here,
on the Continent, and in America, we can hardly
believe that he regretted seriously his own whole-heartedness.
The period of his working life, from
1861 onwards till his death, witnessed an extraordinary
change in the views of geologists upon problems
connected with ice, saw an enormous output of
material in the way of papers and articles and books,
and the world has to be grateful to James Geikie
for both directly and indirectly opening its eyes to
much that was previously hidden.</p>

<p>His glacial work and its significance are alike
discussed by Dr Flett in the <a href="#part-ii" title="Part 2">second part</a> of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
volume, and need not be treated here, but a word or
two is necessary to explain the intense interest which
glacial problems aroused among all the Survey men
during the period we are considering, and in James
Geikie in particular. A quotation from a letter of
thanks written by Charles Darwin, after receiving a
copy of the second edition of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>,
will throw some light upon this. The letter is dated
26th October 1876, and Darwin says:&mdash;“The subject
[<i>i.e.</i>, the Ice Age] is one which fascinates me, chiefly
owing to a little incident which I will mention as
showing the grand progress of geology. When I was
a boy an acute old gentleman who had attended to
geology and natural history showed me a boulder in
Shropshire, and assured me solemnly that the world
would pass away before any one could explain how
this great stone came from Cumberland or Scotland.
This made a deep impression on me, and you may
believe how delighted I was some forty years ago
when floating ice action was first broached, to be
followed some years afterwards by glacier action.”</p>

<p>We see from this letter that the thought of the
mystery of the great boulder haunted Darwin for
years, but the young geologists of the Survey were
confronted not with one boulder, but, day after day,
week after week, with an accumulation of only half-explained
mysteries. When they started work the
view that a large part of the British Islands had
been covered by land ice, and that the boulder-clay
was the record of its passage, had, after a period
of neglect, again come into prominence; but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
very far from being universally accepted (see the
historical discussion in <a href="#part-ii" title="Part 2">Part <abbr title="2">II.</abbr></a>). Then, and for many
years to come, the view that the boulder-clay, erratics,
and so forth had been dropped by floating icebergs
still commanded many followers. The suggestion
that there was not one Glacial Period only but a series
of advances and retreats, with well-marked interglacial
periods between, had yet to be born. Thus
the subject was a burning one at the moment, and
in their meetings, whether in the field or, when the
field-work was done for the season, at headquarters,
the members of the Survey had much to discuss and
to tell, many fragments of evidence to piece together.
They seem all to have been greatly interested in
the subject; but that James Geikie made it so peculiarly
his own was partly due to the constructive
imagination which enabled him to visualise, in a
series of brilliant flashes, not the country as he
saw it, but the former conditions to which it bore
testimony. This constructive imagination was aided
also, as has been indicated, by constant toil and
by ceaseless comparison, by means both of personal
visits and through the writings of others, of local
conditions with those of other regions and of other
lands.</p>

<p>It is also not without significance to note that his
own first work, and indeed generally most of his
Survey work throughout his period of service, lay in
what is described as the peripheral area of the old
glaciation. In any area which is or has been
glaciated it is possible to distinguish between a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
central area where erosion is at a maximum, and
where the evidence of the existence of former ice-sheets
is almost necessarily masked by the work of
later glaciers, and a peripheral area where ice work
takes the form of deposition. In this latter area it is
often possible to unravel the complex evidence to
an extent sufficient to determine the question whether
more than one Glacial Period existed or not. It was
to this problem that James Geikie devoted much of
his attention, and this fact must be regarded as
largely explained by the other that his geological
field-work was done in Lowland rather than in
Highland areas.</p>

<p>In so far as the details of the Survey work go, we
may note that theoretically the summer was devoted
to field-work and the winter to indoor work, at first
either in London or at the Industrial Museum in
Edinburgh, and later, after the establishment of the
Survey Office in Edinburgh, at that office. But
this general scheme was modified considerably by
circumstances. Summer and winter, notably, had a
somewhat different sense from that which the calendar
gives. For example, an entry in his official diary for
1863 states, under date 17th February:&mdash;“Pack-up in
Office for country;” while in the same year field-work
seemed to continue, with short interruptions, till
December. In the following year, 1864, a start was
made even earlier, on 1st February. That somebody
was taking too optimistic a view of Scotch weather is,
however, obvious from the entries in the diary, where
“snow,” “snow,” “snow and rain,” <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>“wet day,”
“snow, 8 or 9 inches” follow each other with a steady
persistency, which justifies the brief entry on 14th
March: “Begin to grow desperate&mdash;lock up my
razors.” At this time Mr Peach and James Geikie
were endeavouring to map the Ochils from Kinross
as a centre, and Dr Peach informs the writer that the
two made strenuous but mostly ineffectual efforts to
get on with their outdoor work at a time when rocks
and superficial deposits alike were concealed in a
thick mantle of snow. Apparently, however, there
were some alleviations, for one of the tantalisingly
short entries in the diary mentions a “Pisgah view
of Ochils,” obtained apparently from Rumbling
Bridge; while Dr Peach states that out of working
hours the two toiled hard at their German.</p>

<p>The mode of study took a direction which had
some influence on James Geikie’s future, and is of
interest on this account. The first impetus to the
study of the language came apparently from Dr Young,
who was very friendly with Dr Schmitz, the Rector
of the High School, whose daughter he married at
a later date. Young had apparently a good knowledge
of the language, and he, early in their
association, urged upon Mr Peach the necessity of
acquiring at least a reading acquaintance with it, and
recommended the learning of German poetry as a
capital means of obtaining a vocabulary. By the
spring of 1864 Mr Peach had already a considerable
repertory, and his recitals roused in James Geikie his
old passion for verse-making. The songs were first
put into rough English, with many jokes about their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
sentimentality, and then James Geikie turned the
rough translations into English verse. This was the
beginning of a pastime which he carried on during
a large part of his life. A selection of the verses
was published in 1887 as <cite>Songs and Lyrics by
Heinrich Heine and other German Poets</cite>. In the
preface the author says that all the renderings there
given were done “for his own amusement in those
‘brave days of youth,’ when difficulties and impossibilities
are hardly recognised.” Many of the verses
were published practically unaltered after more than
twenty years’ interval, for most of them were made in
very early days. They occur in letters, in note-books,
diaries, and in various other places among his papers
of the later sixties, and were evidently a true labour
of love.</p>

<p>As frequent mention has been made of the diaries,
it may be well to state that these for the most part
contain little or nothing save the barest records of
mapping done, hours of work, memoranda as to
expenses, and so forth. Those of the first year or two,
however, not unnaturally, since the work was entirely
new, are a little fuller. That for 1862, if it ever
existed, does not seem to have been preserved; but
1863 contains one or two interesting entries, which
emphasise still further the point already made as to
the enthusiasm, plans, and ambitions with which the
Survey was entered. On its first leaf the following
lines are written:&mdash;“Was not so old last year
as I am this&mdash;fact for the curious biographer who
is no doubt destined to reap immortality by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
interesting use he will make of the copious entries in
this diary.” But as for many weeks afterwards the
“curious biographer” finds no written word beyond
the statement that drawing pens were bought at an
outlay of 1<abbr title="shilling">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, it is to be feared that no superstructure
in regard to an expectation of future fame
can be built upon the entry. The corresponding
page on next year’s diary is more prosaic, for it bears
only a series of “Memoranda” which include an
injunction to get a wife when income allows, and to
have only three children, two boys and one girl.
Rather oddly there is a letter extant which announces
the birth of his third child, many years later, and
bewails the fact that it is another boy, when a girl
would have “rounded off the family so nicely.” The
much-loved daughter did not appear on the scene till
many years afterwards.</p>

<p>From the 1863 diary two short entries may be
quoted, for they stand side by side on the same page,
and are in many ways very characteristic of the man.
The first relates to a day spent in indoor work, though
with the careful corollary that this was not due to the
weather. Opposite this formal entry is written:&mdash;“Mouth
filled with cursings and my heart with evil
thoughts, all owing to the squalling and <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">girning</span>
of an ill-natured, red-headed, unwashed, petted,
fractious imp&mdash;the son and heir of our landlord, the
shepherd.” Some of the epithets have been omitted&mdash;the
provocation was doubtless extreme!</p>

<p>The following day was spent in the open air, and
opposite stands this:&mdash;“Meet J. Y. on top of Black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Law; walk back to Summerhope by way of the
old churchyard. Exquisite moonlight night. Scene
inexpressibly sad&mdash;feel of course very sentimental;
and have a whole troop of depressing thoughts and
reminiscences,&mdash;some of which cause me to heave
sighs like the bellows of the Village Blacksmith.
The ingenious biographer will never guess what these
sighs were for, nor have I any intention of enlightening
him.”</p>

<p>Finally, we may note that the holidays of the
years 1863 and 1864 were both spent in Scotland,
the first on the shores of the Solway and on the coast
of Ayrshire; the second on the Moray Firth, then
north to Brora and south-west to Fort William and
Oban. Both seem to have been largely devoted to
geological work, but were on a less ambitious scale
than many of those of later years.</p>

<p>The late spring and summer of 1864 saw James
Geikie beginning work in Ayrshire, where he was
stationed for some years. With the end of 1864 we
may say that his introductory period of life on the
Survey closed.</p>

<span class="sub_head"><span class="smcap">“The Great Ice Age”: (1) Years of
Preparation</span><br />

1865&ndash;1871</span></h2>


<p>The year 1865 saw James Geikie, as already stated,
doing Survey work in Ayrshire, and this, with its
continuation, the laborious and sometimes tedious
mapping of the Lanarkshire coalfield, kept him in
the west till 1872. Of these years of patient toil,
diversified by independent research upon the drifts,
by geological holidays, and by the making of translations
of Heine and other German poets, comparatively
little has been preserved. His correspondents in these
early days were chiefly the members of his own family,
and most of his letters have been destroyed, except
where the presence of some cherished verses determined
their preservation. From the scanty records
in the diaries, from the few letters that remain, and
from the published account of his surveys, it is,
however, possible to indicate broadly the course of
his daily life.</p>

<p>In 1865 he was stationed in South Ayrshire,
Girvan and Cumnock being two of his centres there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
The most notable event of the year, however, was a
visit to Norway in July to August. Unfortunately,
only the barest notes of this visit remain, and, except
for the descriptions of fiord scenery in <cite>Prehistoric
Europe</cite> and elsewhere, we do not know what impressions
were obtained.</p>

<p>It was apparently chiefly a steamboat journey, with
short excursions to glaciers and other areas of special
interest to the traveller. Boat was taken from Newcastle
to Aalesund, then <i>viâ</i> Molde and Christiansund
(where a brief note records an exquisite sunset about
eleven, with sunrise following at one) to Trondhjem.
After a day in this town the journey was continued
to Rödö and Melövar. From this point a trip was
made in a boat with four men for twenty miles up
the fiord to visit the Fondalen ice-field. Several days
were spent here, and various glaciers were visited
and presumably studied. A return was then made
to Melövar, and the steamer journey continued to
Tromsö. After a day here James Geikie went on to
Skjervö, where he arrived at 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, as is carefully
recorded, and put up at a merchant’s house, no inn
being available. Here he was most hospitably
received, and enjoyed his brief glimpse of a Norwegian
interior. Next day a boat was taken across the fiord
to the Jökul-fjeld, and an apparently profitable
excursion, which included icebergs and icefalls among
the objects seen, ended at a fisherman’s cot at
midnight. Next day was spent idling about, because
the wind was adverse, which suggests that the boat
was a sailing-boat, and the start was not made till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
evening, so that the whole night was passed on the
water, Skjervö not being reached till six in the following
morning. Two days were spent here, and then
the steamer taken to Loppen, from which an excursion
was made to Bergsfiord, where the glacier was
visited. Another excursion was made to Öksfjord,
and the steamboat rejoined as far as Hammerfest, the
furthest point reached. On the return journey the
call at Christiansund permitted of an expedition, taken
in company with the geologist Dr Dahll, during
which a “fierce controversy” took place. Finally, a
Dutch steamer brought the traveller from Bergen to
England after what must have been a most instructive
tour.</p>

<p>The following year, 1866, found him still in
Ayrshire. Little record of it is left, beyond the tale of
work, and the publication of his first scientific paper.
By this time he had moved to the north of Ayrshire,
where he was also in the following year. This year,
1867, witnessed the appearance of his first glacial
paper, this being “On the Buried Forests and Peat
Mosses of Scotland, and the Changes of Climate
which they indicate,” a subject which was to engage
his attention more or less closely for the remainder of
his life. His spare time was still occupied with the
translations, many examples of which occur in his
letters to his sisters. Occasionally his muse took less
serious forms, as may be seen from the lines given
on next page, which appear in a letter much of which
is taken up with translations from “that lugubrious
poet in whose stanzas the word <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">weinen</span></i> is rarely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
omitted&mdash;it may be sweetly rendered by the English
whining.” The lines mentioned follow some criticisms
of the habits of the inhabitants of an Ayrshire town,
where the society, in James Geikie’s words, was
“<span  lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">eminently peeous and drouthie</span>.” The lines are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">Takin’ toddy a’ the week,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Comes the Sabbath day,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Then to Kirk three times they gang,</div>
    <div class="p_line">And sleep the fumes away.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>In the same letter he complains that in this
particular town the invariable question put to you
by strangers whose acquaintance you make is,
“What church do you attend?” He adds that he
had not acquired the reputation of a regular church-goer,
so that one suspects that something less than
the three times a day had to suffice in his case.
From this period probably dates an anecdote which
he used to tell himself of a somewhat unfortunate
visit to a place of worship where, tired out by his
week’s work in the open air, and not perhaps greatly
interested in the discourse, he fell asleep so soundly
as ultimately to fall out of the pew&mdash;at the end of
which he was sitting&mdash;headlong into the aisle. He
had the presence of mind to remain there with his
eyes closed, and was carried out by sympathetic
acquaintances, who thought he had been suddenly
overtaken by serious illness. But when the feet of
the young men were already at the door, the
apparently unconscious patient opened his eyes and
winked at one of his friends to indicate that the fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of Eutychus had not overtaken him on this occasion.
The bearer opposite, with an innocence which did
credit to his piety, had not thought of the obvious
explanation of the accident, and in his astonishment
nearly dropped his burden. History does not,
unfortunately, tell whether his loyalty enabled him
to keep the matter to himself and so preserve his
friend’s reputation. For these, it must be remembered,
were days when a geologist invariably ran the risk of
being suspected of “unsoundness,” by the mere fact
of his occupation, and was, therefore, one for whom
jesting on the threshold of a church was particularly
dangerous.</p>

<p>In this year of 1867 Mr (now Dr) John Horne
joined the Survey, and very shortly afterwards made
James Geikie’s acquaintance. There thus began a
friendship which lasted to the end. Almost from
the first Mr Horne shared Geikie’s enthusiasm for
glacial work, and so early as 2nd April 1868 a letter
from the latter to one of his sisters records the fact
that “Young Horne has got me a lot of information,
and I shall certainly get a lot more.” From this
time, indeed, James Geikie constantly asked his
colleagues for notes about the glacial phenomena in
the areas they were respectively surveying, and for
friendship’s sake was freely supplied with these.
Thus in the course of time he acquired a large
amount of detailed information about the different
parts of Scotland, with answers to many questions
which cropped up in the course of his own investigations.
It was not till his early papers, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the publication of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>, had attracted
the attention of a wider circle of geologists, that this
correspondence was enlarged to include most parts
of the civilised world. As we shall see later, his
early foreign letters gave him great pleasure, even
though, until he realised the value of a feeling for
languages and a good stock of dictionaries, he had
often to ask for help in their translation.</p>

<p>A few lines from a letter to Mr Horne, written
from Eaglesham on 8th May 1868, may help to
show the kind of work he was doing, and reveal
also those characteristics which made his colleagues
willing to give him all the help they could:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Young Man</span>,&mdash;I hope you are still in the land of the
living and the place of hope wherever that may be. These lines I
write unto you not that your joy may be full but that you may
know that I take (I won’t say a fatherly) interest in your welfare,
but any other kind of interest you like but self-interest. What are
you about, and how do you like the work? Is the Drift blinding
your eyes and do you yet see as through a glass darkly? I
suppose your Boulder-clay in the high grounds will give you
no bother. If you get any gravel will you be so good as let me
know whether it occurs in valleys whose watershed is over or under
1000 feet?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr Horne was then working in the Nith valley,
being stationed at Thornhill. James Geikie by this
time had moved from Ayrshire into Renfrewshire
and Lanarkshire.</p>

<p>But the great event of 1868, apart from the
publication of two more glacial papers, was a trip
up the Rhine and on to Switzerland, of which one of
the note-books contains a very full and jovial record,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
which has been supplemented by the recollections of
some of the surviving members of the party, who
were all Survey men. The record is too long to
quote in full, but certain passages may be given.
The opening gives so lively a picture of the party,
and of the rollicking spirits with which they started,
that it cannot be omitted. In connection with the
informality of tone, it must be remembered that the
diary was only a private record of a gay holiday.
It is interspersed, quite characteristically, by very
neat diagrams and sketches, and details of the
geological observations, which were no doubt worked
up afterwards.</p>

and puts to flight notions of dinner in the respective <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">buzzums</span> of
Skae, Horne, and Archie. Peach and I wait so long that our
hunger vanishes. Ladies laid out in corpse-like fashion all over
the deck, and a good deal of basin work performed. Two very
pretty English girls on board&mdash;as pretty I think as I ever saw
before. Both hold up for a while, but after a time they give in
and close up their eyes like daisies. Skae off to bed&mdash;Horne
having meanwhile mysteriously disappeared. Archie follows suit.
I smoke, and Peach in despair hovers about the door of the
feeding saloon in hopes of being able to see something like
preparations for tea. Tea at last! Only 5 out of nearly 150
passengers sit down&mdash;one of them a lady. Peach and I make a
furious onslaught to make up for loss of dinner. Horne, to our
surprise, enters, tastes a cup of tea and beats a hasty retreat. The

berths make appeals which cannot be resisted. Peach and I
make for the deck, where the fresh air revives us, and I finish off
my meal with a pipe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There follow, by one of the sudden transitions
in which the diary abounds, notes on the colour of
the water, and on the jellyfish seen.</p>

<p>A night’s sleep seems to have restored the party,
for they landed at Antwerp the following morning
apparently all in good spirits, and after a stroll round
the town took train for Cologne, passing Liège,
“which lies beautifully in a lovely wooded valley,”
<i>en route</i>. After a short visit to Cologne&mdash;“here I
was pleased to find Heine’s good Christopher in the
Dom”&mdash;the party went on by boat to Königswinter.
“Sail up the Rhine not very interesting, but the
evening is exquisite and the flat country looks well.”
At Königswinter they spent some days&mdash;very hot
ones&mdash;climbing the Siebengebirge and geologising,
with lighter intervals. One of the interludes may
be mentioned:&mdash;“Peach swam across the Rhine in
twelve minutes (before breakfast).”</p>

<p>After a day or two at Königswinter the party
went down the Rhine to Bonn, to see <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Zirkel
there and to visit the museum. Bonn is somewhat
briefly dismissed:&mdash;“This is a lost day. I hate
Bonn ... hooked it back to Königswinter&mdash;and
loafed about.” At Bonn the party met Sir Roderick
Murchison, then Director-General of the Geological
Survey, profanely called “the Duke” in the diary,
for his mannerisms made a strong appeal to the sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of humour of the more lively members of the party.
The veteran geologist&mdash;or at least so the juniors
asserted&mdash;graduated his greetings in careful accordance
with the official position of each. But the old
chief’s genuine interest in geology was shown by his
eager questions about the recent results of the Survey
work in the Southern Uplands.</p>

<p>Finally Königswinter was left, “with regret,” for
the Laacher See, a detailed visit to the Eifel country
being one of the great objects of the tour. James
Geikie’s early work in the Ochils had aroused his
interest in volcanic phenomena, and his geological
notes in regard to the next section of the tour are
singularly full.</p>

<p>The party took steamer to Brohl, and then drove
to the lake, being, as is carefully recorded, cheated
both by the boatman who took them off the steamer
and by the driver. Perhaps the fact accounts for the
next entry:&mdash;“I have seen prettier places than the
Laacher See.” The party had an introduction,
obtained presumably through <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Zirkel, to one of
the fathers at Laach Abbey, and he and a companion
accompanied them on a tour round the lake, in order
to point out the objects of geological interest. A trip
to the Bausenberg was also made. Next day the
members of the party walked to Niedermendig to see
the famous quarries there. Here they tasted the beer
stored in the caverns, and characteristically&mdash;for
James Geikie did not have to wait for Mr Chesterton
to sing the merits of beer&mdash;the diary devotes nearly
equal space to the geology and the beverage. “It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
was deliciously cold and I like the flavour. I had
heard much of the coldness of this beer, viz., that no
one could drink more than a small glassful at a time.
But I found no difficulty in taking down a good pint,
and if I had not had the mine to get out of, I could
easily have stowed away double the quantum.”</p>

<p>Some other interesting excursions were made in
the neighbourhood of the Laacher See, in company
with the friendly monks, and then finally the party set
off in a farm wagon for a thirty-mile drive to Daun,
in the heart of the Eifel country, over very rough
roads. The vehicle was cheap, but this seems to
have been its only merit, and the driver, a prosperous
peasant with money in the bank, as he explained to
them, had the disadvantage of not knowing the way.
The journey took over twelve hours, and when the
tired party reached the village it was to find that it
was market-day there, and rooms were difficult to
obtain, so that the weary scientists had to seek
lodgings where they could, some in an inn, where
they were “nearly eaten up with fleas,” and others in
a private house. After a day here, another long
drive was taken to Bertrich, where the better hotels,
an indirect result of the local medicinal springs,
revived the drooping spirits of the diarist. Unfortunately
the bill next morning proved that the presence
of the visitors had another effect also, and the tone
of the diary again becomes subdued, till, after a long
drive, the Moselle was reached, and its scenery had a
restorative effect.</p>

<p>At Cochem the geologists engaged a boat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
two men to row them forty miles down the Moselle
to Coblentz. The first twenty miles, it is carefully
explained, were delightful; but darkness came on long
before the destination was reached, and it was
midnight before an unwilling dockkeeper allowed the
boat to enter Coblentz. But in spite of the fatigue
and tedium of the long journey, the diarist expresses
himself as highly delighted with the trip.</p>

<p>Coblentz did not make a favourable impression on
the travellers, and the diary contains some caustic
remarks on the Prussian soldiers, with whom the town
was full, and on the Prussian officers whose manners
at table in the hotel were a trial to persons accustomed
to place reliance upon a fork rather than a knife as an
implement for conveying food into the mouth. The
subject is one which recurs more than once, for James
Geikie, who was singularly susceptible to feminine
charm, seemed to resent strongly the general lack of
it among the German ladies met with, and could not
reconcile himself to the sight of a Fräulein disposing
of peas by a method whose only advantage was its
rapidity. If the sound reflection that a lady who
habitually uses a broad-bladed knife for this purpose
is rarely so clumsy as to slit her mouth completely
from ear to ear in the process occurred to him, it
evidently afforded no consolation, and he found it
difficult to sit out a meal in a German hotel if peas
entered into the menu. He himself attempted no
missionary work, however, though he records meeting
two “Yankees,” one of whom “had induced one or two
German ladies to use their forks instead of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
knives for pitching in the victuals. They were
surprised, they told him, that the fork could do the
work so nicely!”</p>

<p>At Coblentz two of the party, Messrs Horne and
Skae, turned back, while the rest went on to
Goarshausen, where they passed a delightful couple
of days. “It is one of the prettiest spots in all the
Rhine country.” The next stop was at Heidelberg,
where the customary sights were visited, and the
scarred countenances of the students commented on
with true British disgust; the journey was then
continued <i>viâ</i> Basle, Berne, Thun, and Interlaken to
Grindelwald. Here the famous guide Peter Michel
was engaged, and the party spent “a most interesting
day” on the glaciers. “The ice phenomena were
well seen, but best on the lower glacier.” So
successful was the excursion that it was resolved,
though all were inexperienced, to make the crossing
of the Strahlegg to the Grimsel. Bad weather made
it necessary to stop two nights at the Bäregg hut,
and of these and the day’s imprisonment an amusing
description is given. On the second day the weather
cleared and the chalet was left at five, and, after
a tiring day, the party reached the Grimsel at six
in the evening, some of the members being much
fatigued. Some interesting observations were made
<i>en route</i>. From the Grimsel the party made their way
down the Rhone valley to Lake Geneva, and at this
point the diary ends abruptly. The excursion, it is
clear, was one of great interest, and coupled with the
previous visit to Norway, must have played an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
important part in helping James Geikie to visualise
the Europe of the Ice Age.</p>

<p>The next three years, 1869, 1870, and 1871, were
spent for the most part in hard and continuous work
on the coalfields, though in all three years the published
papers, no less than the letters, show that all the
energy which could be spared from the daily routine
was being given to glacial work.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1869 James Geikie started work
at Carluke, and an entertaining letter to his mother
has been preserved, dated from here on 4th April.
It is long and largely about family affairs, but a few
quotations may be made, for the tone throws light
upon the character both of mother and son. The
letter begins abruptly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This being a day of rest not only for the beasts that do the work
of men, but also for the men that do the work of beasts, it behoveth
me thy son to throw aside the cares of the world and the many
humbugs that do so easily beset me, and to refresh my soul
and peradventure thine also by inditing these few words, to the
intent that thou, O my maternal parent! may know of a surety
that I thy son am well, and that thy two daughters who sojourn
with me here in the wilderness are even as I am....</p>

<p>Write unto me, O my maternal parent! and tell me how
it fareth with thy trees which yield fruit of their kind, and with
the flowers which thou dost tend in the house that is heated
with pipes and hot water in the pipes. And say unto my paternal
parent that he hath forgotten me&mdash;that I am even as one of the
dead&mdash;that I long to see the writing of his hand.</p>

<p>Here many friends visit me not&mdash;but I am not grieved&mdash;and my
waistcoats grow tight about me....</p>

<p>Thy daughters salute thee and the paternal&mdash;so I salute ye all in
like manner. My blessing abide with ye&mdash;and in the bonds of love
I subscribe myself.&mdash;Yours affectionately.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Other family letters in the same year are written
from Hamilton, one, dated 19th July, containing the
information in regard to his translations that “I have
so many now that I think if I go on for a month
or so longer I shall have enough to make a small
volume.”</p>

<p>The allusion to fruit-trees, in the letter quoted
above, it is interesting to note, was especially to
a pear-tree which grew in the garden of the house in
Duncan Street where the family lived at this time.
The house is one of two which a few years ago
were converted by the Edinburgh School Board into
a special school, and in the course of the alterations
the jargonelle pear-tree, which figures in many of the
family letters, was cut down. It seems to have
been a prolific bearer in its prime, and in one of
his letters James Geikie alludes to receiving a basket
of the fruit, and at the same time to the prolonged
silence of the members of the family, which he
explains as the result of the “pear-disease,” <i>i.e.</i>, the
absorption of his sisters in the task of consuming the
fruit. He himself sends some rhymes in return for
his share.</p>

<p>The year 1870 finds him still busy on the coalfield,
his diary for that year being full of notes of appointments
with people connected with the pits, while
he seems to have been constantly moving from place
to place in Lanarkshire.</p>

<p>Two letters from <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay in July of
this year have an historical interest. The first
suggests a joint tour on the Rhine to solve a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
geological problem, and is followed almost at once
by another, saying, “Now I fear my Rhine journey
is blown to the winds.... This most wicked and
accursed war will upset half the Continent of Europe,
and it is by no means impossible that we may be
dragged into it”&mdash;upon which one feels disposed
to make the comment that if we had been it is
possible that infinite suffering might have been saved
forty-four years later! A letter from James Geikie to
Mr Horne, written later in the same year, says:&mdash;“My
holidays, I think I told you, were all botched.
I could not get abroad, and I had nowhere particular
to go at home.”</p>

<p>At this time he was stationed at Salsburgh by
Holytown, where he made several friends, notably
Dr Grossart, with whom afterwards he kept up
a correspondence for many years.</p>

<p>In the letter to Mr Horne quoted above he
says:&mdash;“I have been doing a little at those German
translations, and have now finished the volume, and
am on the outlook for a publisher who won’t cheat
me. I wish to have the thing published this winter”&mdash;a
wish which was not, however, fulfilled for many
winters. In the same letter he adds:&mdash;“I am
still among coal ... but Xmas is coming, and then
one will have an opportunity of washing the dirt
away. I like this place very well. The house is
clean, and the district is moory&mdash;just on the outskirts
of the great coalfield. I mean to work out
as much as I can from here so as to shorten
my stay in Glasgow, of which (I) got tired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
After all there is nothing like the free fresh air
of the country.”</p>

<p>The next year, 1871, saw the finishing up of
the coalfield work, and simultaneously the beginnings
of a gathering together of the accumulated mass
of glacial material which was a year or two later
to take shape in <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>. Letters
in the early part of the summer to Mr Horne contain
detailed plans for a tour in the Hebrides “for the
purpose of ascertaining the direction of ice-striæ,
and quizzing the drifts.” It proved impossible for
his friend to join him, and the tour was made in
company with Mr William Galloway, one of many
friends made in the west.</p>

<p>Mr Galloway has kindly supplied a few notes
on the tour. The two sailed from Glasgow to
Stornoway by the Crinan Canal, and walked to the
north point of the island, carrying their belongings
with them. Both had a special purpose in view,
James Geikie being engaged, of course, in studying
glacial action, while his friend had been commissioned
to investigate the possibility of establishing a meteorological
station at the lighthouse on the Butt of Lewis.
On their way back to Barvas they came across an old
highland woman who made cups and saucers of
unbaked clay. James Geikie was much interested in
her work, and ordered a set. It was despatched
to Lady (then Mrs) Ramsay, the wife of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Ramsay, then Senior Director of the Geological
Survey (<i><abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr></i> <a href="#part-ii" title="Part 2">Part <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>)</a>, as a sample of prehistoric
ware from the Outer Hebrides. The joke was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
explained later, but not before, or so it is asserted,
some high archæological authorities in London had
been taken in by the “primitive” appearance of
the work.</p>

<p>The travellers, presumably on the homeward
journey, began a joint composition in heroic verse
describing their adventures; but this masterpiece
seems never to have been committed to paper, and
perhaps never progressed very far.</p>

<p>The tour was apparently short, for James Geikie
writes from Bathgate, under date 28th November:&mdash;“This
last year has been a year of close work
and some anxiety, and not having had any holiday
to speak of I feel jaded and down in the mouth.”</p>

<p>In all his letters of this year he speaks of his
laborious work among the collieries, and his note-books
are filled with the usual details of appointments
made and notes of information received from different
quarters. The following spring saw him in more
congenial surroundings in the Border counties, and
this chapter may fitly end with the completion of
his coalfield work. It may be added, however, that
letters from Ramsay, received at the close of the
year, and dealing with the problems raised by James
Geikie’s paper on “Changes of Climate during
the Glacial Epoch,” a paper of which Ramsay
thought highly, show clearly what the years of
preparation had done for him, despite their almost
ceaseless toil.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that life was
made up of nothing but toil, alleviated by occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
holidays. For many years a considerable amount of
the Survey work was done in London, and parts
of many winters were spent there. In addition
to the Survey men, James Geikie had a considerable
number of friends and acquaintances in London, his
father’s musical connections opening various musical
and artistic circles to him. Both in scientific and
artistic circles his social gifts were much appreciated,
and he himself must have found the winter glimpses
into a wider social life than he could find either
in the country districts or in the smaller towns
of Scotland a most welcome change.</p>

1872&ndash;1874</span></h2>

<p>In the year 1872 James Geikie was somewhat late in
beginning field-work, but the end of April saw him
established at Kelso. An interesting letter to his
friend Dr Grossart at Holytown, dated 4th May, may
be quoted as showing his feelings in regard to his
new sphere:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I found I could not make out a flying visit to Salsburgh before
leaving the west country for good. But I hope to see you some
time before the year is very old. I have been knocking about a
good deal since I saw you, but, praise be <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">thankit</span>! I have at last
got back into the country. And what a lovely country it is!
Coming so soon after Airdrie and Coatbridge it looks quite like
another world. I can hardly believe that I am in the same planet
where coal and iron are being worked. Here is nothing but the
sandstones below the limestones and the Old Red with its trap
rocks. The people too are as sleepy and old-fashioned and
“respectable” as the rocks they live upon or rather <em>above</em>. This
is the kind of land that would be after your own heart. Here
are old abbeys and tumble-down castles, and every field and stream
has some old-world story connected with it. At first I hardly
could <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">thole</span> the quiet of Kelso. I have lived so much of late
amongst smoke and din that for a week or so I felt like a fish out
of water. The big market-place here, with nobody in it, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>depressing to look at. I didn’t like the way either that the shopkeepers
rushed upon me when I ventured into their shops&mdash;it
looked for all the world as if they never had had any customer but
me since the New Year. And yet they tell me that Kelso is a
thriving country town. It may be so&mdash;very likely it is so&mdash;but it
seems to one newly come from the stirring “west” like a dead-alive
place.</p>

<p>What are you about? How does the great “work”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1" /><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> progress?
I have been compelled to drop scribbling for a little, having rather
overdone it this winter in Bathgate and Edinburgh. But the smell
of the spring woods and hedges has set me up again, and I meditate
an early assault on pen and ink.</p>

  was engaged. It appeared in 1880.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A letter to Mr Horne, from Kelso, in the same
month of May, strikes a somewhat similar note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Here I am, in the midst of green trees, <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">purling</span> brooks,
whistling <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">mavises</span> and love-sick young ladies. I feel quite a new
man now that I am released from the presence of coal smoke and
pits; up to any amount of fun as of yore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same letter he speaks of the reception met
with by his glacial papers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have had some very gratifying letters from Sweden and
Switzerland from geologists there&mdash;saying how much they are
pleased with my results, and giving me more notes which help out
my conclusions. It seems they have interglacial periods in Sweden
also. Of all places in the world I had also a letter from a <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Szabó of Pest in Hungary. So that you see a prophet is not without
honour save in his own country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another letter, also written from Kelso, on 15th
June, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Man&mdash;I feel awfully tempted to go to Sweden, where I have
the promise of meeting with a warm welcome from some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>geologists. But I can’t go, and have reluctantly had to delay a
visit till next year. I continue now and again to get a gratifying
letter about my papers which cheers me up amazingly. Woodward
the editor<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2" /><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> writes to-night congratulating me on the wind-up, and
saying that everyone speaks highly of my lucubrations. After trying
my hands at many things I think I have at last got into the right
groove. The noble hammer-bearing fraternity have not heard the
last of my “theories.” ... What a fertile source of amusement
this blessed Glacial Epoch has been!</p>

  appeared.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The summer holiday this year was spent in Lewis,
but the chief record which remains is that contained
in papers contributed to the <cite>Quarterly Journal of the
Geological Society</cite> and the <cite>Geological Magazine</cite>. In
September he writes from Norham an affectionate
letter to Dr Grossart, expressing longing for a
“<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">haver</span>,” and giving news of his glacial work. The
letter goes on:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How does the <i>magnum opus</i> progress? I am still working
away at mine&mdash;nearly finished&mdash;both me and my book. I got
some very startling facts this summer in the island of Lewis which
I shall send to the London <abbr title="Geological">Geolog.</abbr> Society&mdash;the facts, not the
island.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A month later he writes from Duns to Mr Horne
in regard to some specimens which he wants for a
course of lectures to be given to working-men at the
Museum of Science and Art during the winter. In
this letter he speaks of being attacked by a form of
nervous prostration which renders him incapable of
continued work, so that the <i>magnum opus</i> is at a
standstill. The task was evidently proving more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>severe than he anticipated, and the illness was prolonged,
for in a letter to Dr Grossart, written from
Edinburgh on 4th January 1873, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This winter things have gone back with me. I was laid up
most of November and December, but am now all right again. But
this enforced idleness has kept back my book, which the longer I
stick at it seems to grow and grow till I begin to get frightened at
its dimensions. This summer, however, I hope to send it to the
printer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same letter he speaks of his lectures at
the Museum of Science and Art, and also of another
on the “Antiquity of Man in Britain,” which he was
to give at Birkenhead at the beginning of February.
The lecture, which was duly delivered and also
published, dealt with a subject to which he had been
led by his glacial work. It was one in which his
interest increased as time went on, and in later
years “Man during the Ice Age” occupied a good
deal of his leisure, up to the very end.</p>

<p>At Duns James Geikie made a number of friends,
and indeed throughout his work in the Border counties
he seems to have met with much hospitality, and
this even before his sojourn in Jedburgh led to his
acquaintanceship with the family in which he found
his wife, and to the region becoming a second homeland
for him. During his stay at Duns the book
was progressing steadily, despite his hard work in
the field. In June he was writing to Mr Horne
and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay for information in regard to
certain special points, and the latter was very anxious
for James Geikie to accompany him on a geologising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
holiday to the Rhine, to investigate some disputed
questions. This proposal was not accepted, however,
apparently because James Geikie was dissatisfied
with the only information he could obtain about
glacial deposits on the south side of the Alps, and
made up his mind to seek satisfaction by a personal
tour to the district. This trip is mentioned in a letter
written to Dr Grossart from Kelso on 20th July, in
which he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My summer has been spent in a ram-sham desultory sort of
way. I have hammered out the geological structure of the
Cheviots, which is something interesting and new, and I have also
got some interesting glacial results. I have had a hard time of it
with the lawyers though, having been summoned twice to London
to give evidence before Committees of Parliament about that
confounded Edinburgh water of which every honest man in
Edinburgh is heartily sick. I know I am. But that is over now.
In a fortnight I start for Italy, and am going to make a long tour
of it: Paris, Geneva, Martigny, Aosta, Turin, Bologna, Verona,
Venice, Trieste, and Vienna, then back through the Tyrol and
down the Rhine to Rotterdam, Amsterdam, etc., and home. I
shall be a fortnight or three weeks scouring along the foot of the
Piedmontese Alps looking at the glacial things.</p>

<p>My book is finished and off to the printers at last. But I fear
that it will be delayed by the engraver, who does not get on with
the illustrations as fast as I could wish. Anyhow I hope I shall be
able to send you a copy this winter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No detailed account of the Italian trip has been
preserved, but various letters make allusions to it.
Thus writing to Mr Horne from Jedburgh on
17th September, he speaks of his visit to Lake
Como, ending up:&mdash;“Alas! all the sunshine is over,
and here I am in dull Scotch autumn, thinking sadly
that the world and one’s destinies are not more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
amenable to one’s wishes. But Scotland is not so
bad after all.” His next visit to the lake was made
in company with his wife and her sister, and during
the trip he told how on his first visit he had lost
himself in the Alps at dark, and after some difficulty
and various adventures reached a little hamlet. Here
there was no inn, but the priest of the village kindly
put him up for the night, the two conversing in Latin
in default of any other means of communication.</p>

<p>He speaks also of his Italian tour in a letter to
Dr Grossart, dated from Jedburgh on 11th October,
in which he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Did I write you giving an account of my Italian trip? I know
that I meant to do so. I enjoyed myself amazingly, and picked up
a lot of wrinkles which will stand me in good stead. <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Ods man!</span>
but it was hot <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">spielin’</span> the hills with the thermometer 94° in the
shade. God knows but I thought it not far short of 500° in the
sun.... I’m going to take it easy this winter&mdash;if I can. I have
now got my <i>magnum opus</i> off my hands, and hope to send you a
copy next month. It makes some 500 pages of demy <abbr title="octavo">8vo</abbr>!&mdash;a
<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">wiselike</span> size!... The illustrations will please you, I hope.
They have been beautifully engraved.... The country here is
looking beautiful&mdash;woods having all their autumn colours on. I
don’t wonder that emigrants who were born on the Jed, the Teviot,
and the Tweed should <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">aye</span> have such intense longings to get back
again to their native <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">howffs</span>. It makes one young as a boy to
wander up the sweet glens and ravines in this lovely district. If
I were in love I’m afraid I should use up whole reams of paper in
the composing of passionate songs and sonnets. But not being so
I can only croon as I trot along the half-forgotten words of some
old Border ditty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some other passages in this and other letters
suggest that with the finishing of the great book,
and the lifting of the strain, the young man felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<i>désœuvré</i>, was beginning to think that youth was
slipping away and he was perhaps not getting the
best out of life, and was liable to alternate fits of
depression and of a cynicism which was probably
largely a pose intended to hide his true feelings.
In brief, he was becoming aware that it is not good
for man to dwell alone, and the Glacial Epoch, whatever
its charms, proved a chilly substitute for the
kind of companionship which his affectionate spirit
craved. A few extracts from a letter, undated,
but written from Jedburgh, apparently about the
same time as the foregoing, may help to make the
position clear. The letter may be entitled&mdash;anything
more specific being avoided&mdash;“To a Young Man
contemplating Matrimony,” and the quotations must
necessarily be disjointed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You know your own affairs best. But if I were in your place,
and the girl were a really good girl and suitable, hang it I would
propose and get her.... Something like fate whispers in my
ear, “Jim, my boy, you’ll never have a wife, altho’ you should live
to the age of Methusaleh.” ... With the uncertainty of temper
and feeling that I have, I seriously doubt whether I would be other
than miserable if I were to marry. So lest you should get into the
same state, O young man! either flee temptation or be bold and
seize the tempter. What more can I say. Perhaps you were only
laughing when you wrote me, and are now laughing at me and my
soft-heartedness. All right, laugh away. I have had my day, and
some time you shall have had yours also.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it may be added that when this letter was
written its author was thirty-four. His marriage
took place some eighteen months later, after an
engagement which had lasted more than six months.
He was destined to experience nearly forty years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
happy married life, to see his children grow up, to
welcome the advent of his grandchildren&mdash;either it
was not fate who did the whispering, or she displayed
a more than feminine contrariness.</p>

<p>Other letters during the autumn months give
merely notes on the progress of the book, which was
unexpectedly delayed, and information as to his
prospective plans for the winter in Edinburgh. One
to Dr Grossart, dated from Jedburgh on 22nd
November, may be quoted as summing up what is
said in various other letters which have been
preserved:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>With this I send you a short lucubration of mine on the Island
of Lewis, the chief point in which is the proof given that the Outer
Hebrides were overflowed by land ice from the mainland!</p>

<p>I am happy to say that I am nearly out of the hands of the
printer. My book has swelled out beyond what I intended,
making close on 600 pages. The illustrations, which have kept
back the printing, are now finished, and I expect to have a bound
copy in my hands in ten days or so. It won’t be published, however,
much before Xmas, as we have made arrangements with an American
firm to publish it at the same time in Yankee land. This is a great
stroke of good luck, as it will lessen the cost of production and make
the book payable. Some of the maps I believe you will find very
interesting. In fact, I have so written the book that whether
geologists accept all my general conclusions or not, they will at
least know a good deal that they did not know before, after they
have perused it.... I am booked for a series of lectures this
winter at the Museum of Science and Art, my subject being the
Carboniferous Epoch. I am going to treat it in a pictorial way,
trying to reproduce for them the kind of scenery and climate then
enjoyed in Britain. I have also a lot more literary work in hand&mdash;<cite>A
Manual on Coal-Mining</cite>&mdash;in which I do the geology and an
engineering celebrity does the practical part. This and other
matters keep my hands full. Nevertheless I have still an occasional
dig at my German Songs. (Strange mixture! you will say. But then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>man is a queer mixture altogether.) Some time or other the Songs
will see the light&mdash;but as I look on that matter as pleasure, and
the scientific work as business, the Songs must stand aside till their
betters are served. Write and give me your news. You see, like
an old bachelor I have nothing to write about but myself. So you
must under the circumstances excuse the egotism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The book appeared early in the New Year, and
the fact that the author was then in Edinburgh and
must have presented copies to his nearest friends in
person, no doubt accounts for the absence of many
letters acknowledging receipt among his papers.
Two notes from <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay, to whom, as his
“dear friend and teacher,” the book was dedicated,
may, however, be quoted. Both are dated from
Jermyn Street, and are written on successive days,
20th and 21st January 1874. The letters are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Geikie</span>,&mdash;I have got your beautiful <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> quite late
in the day and am now engaged in physically cutting it up.
Your dedication makes me so proud that since reading it I have
held my head quite like the Duke of Argyll, and I only hope it will
not fall off behind. I must close, and will take the book home with
me to read the dedication aloud in an impressive way after
dinner.&mdash;Ever sincerely,</p>

<p class="signed smcap"><abbr title="Andrew">Andrw.</abbr> Ramsay.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Geikie</span>,&mdash;I will read all your book, <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">mair</span> by token
that I read 4 chapters of it last night after dinner and liked them
all. The plan is good and it is admirably written, as indeed it was
sure to be.... As for your converting every reader to all your
views, that is not likely as long as the Duke of Argyll remains alive.
When a man does anything really in advance he may be well
pleased if in 10 or 14 years he gets a fair proportion of the best
men on his side. So no more this bout. From yours consumedly,</p>

<p class="signed smcap"><abbr title="Andrew">Andrw.</abbr> Ramsay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>In May of the same year Ramsay writes again,
saying:&mdash;“I am delighted to hear of the success of
your book, which indeed I never doubted, for I always
considered it a first-rate production, though I have
only read it by snatches.”</p>

<p>But though James Geikie had lingered long in the
company of the Ice Maiden, he had not given her
that embrace which is fatal to the earth-born, and the
summer of this year brought him other thoughts than
those of glaciers and moraines, brought him to a new
phase in his life which demands another chapter.</p>

<span class="sub_head"><span class="smcap">Marriage and Life at Perth</span><br />
1875&ndash;1877</span></h2>

<p>In the spring of 1874 James Geikie returned from
Edinburgh to the Cheviot region. Before starting
his field-work he made a brief visit to the Continent,
in regard to which his diary only contains records
of dates and places. The motive of the visit is of
interest as throwing light on his strong family feeling.
At his instigation his youngest sister had gone to
Germany to improve herself in the language. On
arriving in the place arranged, however, she found
herself very uncomfortable and unhappy, and informed
her brother of the fact. With characteristic energy
he set off at once, met his sister, arranged for her
transference to more congenial surroundings, and in
a little more than a week was back to work again.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards he went off to Jedburgh to
take up again his survey in the Cheviots. Here he
made many friends, and during his stay in the region
acquired an intense love for the scenery of the hills,
whose long gentle slopes and soft melancholy always
appealed to him more than the stern grandeur of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Highlands. This feeling was perhaps not wholly
æsthetic, however, for the district soon acquired
associations for him which are briefly hinted at in
the diary for the year. This&mdash;of somewhat unusual
form&mdash;is adorned, oddly enough, with a portrait of
John Stuart Mill as frontispiece. The philosopher’s
serious, intellectual countenance has, it is to be feared
in derision, been decorated by the owner of the diary
with a long pipe. It would indeed be difficult to
imagine two men of more different type; for James
Geikie, the utilitarian’s long years of waiting and
longing would have been as intolerable as the brief
fever of the last days.</p>

<p>The entries in the diary are as usual short in the
extreme, but under 12th August, which it is carefully
noted was a wet day, the diarist was at a picnic in
the Cheviots. He adds the word “lost”? to the
laconic entry. Later entries record calls made to
Crailing Hall with brief comments. About this time
James Geikie was writing to his friend Mr Horne,
saying:&mdash;“John Horne&mdash;come to the Cheviots....
I’ll do what I can in the way of introductions.” Much
of the letter is occupied with geological matters, and
the writer goes on to express a hope that he won’t be
asked to give a course of lectures to working-men
during the coming winter:&mdash;“I want all my time for
literary work this winter, seeing that I have agreed
to write two books&mdash;one for a London house, the
other for an Edinburgh one. Besides, I have at last
made up my mind to go and get married, and as soon
as I come across a likely girl, will lose no time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
taking the grand header. I hope never to see another
autumn as a bachelor. So what with hunting
libraries for notes, and hunting up families for a nice
wife, I have my winter’s work laid out before me.”</p>

<p>It will appear from this letter that James Geikie
did not keep his heart on his sleeve. The letter is
not perhaps wholly candid, but candour was doubtless
not to be expected at such a time.</p>

<p>A few details may be added to make the story
clear. None of the towns or hamlets at the foot of
the Cheviots was near enough to form a good centre
of work, and the region being given up to large sheep
farms, habitations of any kind among the hills are
few and scattered. Among James Geikie’s acquaintances
in the Jedburgh district was Mr Simson,
Oxnam Row, to whose farm on the lower slopes were
added the hill grazings higher up the Kale Water.
Here, right among the hills, was the old farmhouse of
Buchtrig, in the occupation of a shepherd and his
wife, but with some rooms so furnished as to permit
of the family making occasional visits to the region.
Through Mr Simson James Geikie was able to
arrange for accommodation here in the early spring
of 1874 to facilitate his work. A few notes of his
visit are left in his own handwriting, in what he
styles a “Copy of a Fragment of some very ancient
Manuscript.” This opens as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It happened once upon a time that a certain youth, who
dreamed strange dreams and wandered about the hill-tops and
sojourned in lonely places, came unto a lonely dwelling among the
mountains and there abode for many days. And an old woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>ministered unto his wants with fear and trembling, for she looked
upon him as one that was beside himself. “Verily,” said she unto
herself, “he looketh for some hidden treasure, and is a magician
who smiteth the rocks with a hammer and writeth strange incantations
and evil words in a book.” And she looked, and behold he
brought with him from the mountains pieces of stone which he
treasured and laid in safe places.... Now after many days the
old woman, who was called Katie, put away her fear, for the young
man seemed not to hold communication with the Evil One, neither
was the smell of brimstone perceived in the place. And so she
showed him much kindness, and baked cakes of flour upon the
<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">girdle</span> and brought these to him, and eggs, yea, and much fine
butter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the early summer of the same year James
Geikie went for his holiday to Skye and Lewis. Not
long after his return he was invited to the picnic
already mentioned, which, owing to the weather, was
adjourned to Buchtrig farmhouse. The picnic was
given by Mr Simson, and included his sister, Mrs
Johnston, Crailing Hall, and her three daughters,
with two of whom James Geikie was already
acquainted. The <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> may be allowed to take up the
story at this point:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And so the days passed away, and the young man went into a
far country, yea unto the furthermost isles of the sea. But in the
fullness of time he returned, and found the place which had been a
desert now filled with the hum of voices and laughter of damsels.
And he looked, and behold there were chariots and a wagon filled
with good things. And he entered into the house where he had
sojourned aforetime, and lo! a fair damsel met him and bade him
welcome. And she said unto him, “Enter now, and embrace my
sisters and my mother, yea and my mother’s brother’s wife and her
daughter.” And it was so. And when the young man entered
into an upper room, behold a maiden stood near the window....
And his eyes followed her whithersoever she went&mdash;and he spoke
unto her presently as one speaketh unto an old friend. And the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>sound of her voice was like the music of the birds in spring, and the
heart of the young man began to sing a new song. Listen and ye
shall hear what the young man sang: Here ends the Manuscript.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This happened in August, and before Christmas
James Geikie was engaged to Mary, youngest
daughter of Mr Johnston, Crailing Hall, to whom
he was married on 8th July 1875.</p>

<p>But in addition to what we may call the major
associations with the Cheviot region due to these
incidents, he had many minor ones of a pleasurable
nature. He came into contact with all sorts
of people in the course of his wanderings, and in
that sparsely peopled district it was easy to make
acquaintances. Among his temporary dwelling-places
in the hills was the little inn, called Carter Bar,
which then stood on the slopes of Carter Fell, and
was but little more than a rest-house for drovers
going over the border into England with their sheep.
On one stormy day in spring James Geikie was
returning to this poor shelter over the moor, when
he encountered an old lady, somewhat oddly dressed,
drenched with rain, and struggling against the
wind. He went to her assistance, and she was glad
to accept the offer of his arm to help her back to
the inn. Here she borrowed dry garments from
the hostess, and sat and talked over the fire with her
new-found friend, who found her full of Border lore,
while he no doubt contributed his full share to the
conversation. Eventually, her own garments being
dry, and she herself refreshed, the old lady drove
off in a waiting carriage, urging James Geikie to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
to see her. She proved to be Lady John Scott,
a well-known Border personage, famous for her
antiquarian tastes, her Scotch songs, and her great
individuality of character.</p>

<p>Another similar meeting which led to a long
friendship, though it took place several years later,
may fitly find a place here. This was with Sir
George Douglas, of Springwood Park, Kelso, the
author of <cite>The New Border Tales</cite>, <cite>Poems</cite>, and a
number of other works, many referring to the Border
region. Sir George has kindly supplied the following
notes upon the subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I owed my acquaintance with the late <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie to a chance
meeting. Starting on a solitary walking-tour, in the summer
vacation of the year 1878, I called at the Collingwood Arms,
Cornhill, for tea, and found him there. He was not yet
professor at that date, but was a member of H.M. Geological
Survey, the work of which had brought him to Cornhill, where
he was waiting for a train to Tweedmouth. He was then in
the early prime of manhood, and his work being of a more
active nature and taking him more into the open air, the cheery
vigour which at all times characterised him was more pleasantly
noticeable than ever. I remember that his beard, which he
afterwards wore close-cropped, at that time descended over
his chest and was of a golden colour. I believe that we began
by talking of inns, for I remember that he poked some good-natured
fun at the commercial travellers of those days (“bagmen,”
as he perversely preferred to call them), and told me two or
three amusing stories of experiences with them. But, ere long,
we were talking of literature, and especially of poetry&mdash;the poetry
of the day. Here was a delight for me! I was at the poetry-reading
age, and had just left Cambridge, where I had primed
myself with Swinburne, William Morris, the Rossettis&mdash;that is,
with such of their works as had at that date appeared; and not
only with these, but with such poems as the “Angel in the
House,” “White Rose and Red,” “The Human Tragedy”:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>the works of lesser masters, then on their probation, and now,
it may be, seldom heard of. Well, here in a wayside inn at the
extremity of Northumberland, I had chanced upon an unknown
traveller who had all these authors and books, so to speak,
at his fingers’ ends. One would have liked, at that age, to
pose him, to make some pedantical allusion, as to a matter
of common knowledge, to something of which he had not
happened to hear. But it was vain to hope to go beyond him.
And, if we were fairly evenly matched in our discussion, it must
be borne in mind that I was, as it were, staking my all in it,
whilst he was merely gambling with his small change. For of
course he never professed literature, but merely turned to it for
a change of idea in hours that were not occupied by science.
What was really remarkable in this conversation, I should say,
was the readiness and whole-heartedness with which he threw
himself into it, the stimulus given by his never-failing interest
and occasional enthusiasm, the fine good-nature with which he
unquestioningly put himself on equal terms with one who was
many years younger than himself, and whose opinions, however
confidently expressed, must often have been crude and immature.
Neither then, nor at any subsequent time, was there anything
whatever that was pedantic or academic about Geikie. When
I met him next, I was approaching the middle term of life,
but the recollection of that single conversation suffices to
make quite clear to me the power which he wielded over his
students and the popularity which he enjoyed among them. I
doubt if the very best that was in him really made itself felt
upon the lecture-platform. It was in the give-and-take of life&mdash;in
his Saturday geological tramps and other more informal
relations with his students, if I may hazard a guess&mdash;that the
man really stood revealed. He could impart life and glow to
his subject, as perhaps few can. But he did so best, if I may
pretend to judge, when he was talking rather than lecturing.</p>

<p>I had evidence of this later. On parting after our two or
three hours’ talk at Cornhill, we had exchanged cards, and when
I heard that, in order to be near Mrs Geikie’s relations, he was
renting Kalemouth on Teviot, four or five miles from my house,
during one summer vacation, I hastened to renew acquaintance
with him. Since our former meeting ten or twelve years had
passed, and though it had remained delightfully memorable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>me, I did not presume to suppose that he would remember it, nor
was any allusion made to it. Being such near neighbours throughout
that summer we met often, and it was then that I really got
to know the character and qualities which had been merely suggested
at Cornhill. From the geological point of view, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie
knew the Borderland as no one else knew it; but he had also a
remarkable knowledge, not only of its scenery, history, and tradition,
but also of its people, collectively and individually; and this gave
us a strong interest in common.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some other moorland experiences were of a more
humorous nature. Thus one Sunday night he was
walking back from Crailing Hall to his lodgings
at Morebattle, and came in the dusk past the hamlet
of Cessford. He was carrying a small handbag,
and as he passed the cottages a woman ran out
and called out in a loud whisper:&mdash;<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">“Man, man,
can ye gie me half a pound o’ tea?”</span> She had
mistaken him for a pedlar, perhaps not unwilling
to earn an ungodly penny. The situation appealed
strongly to his sense of humour, and he rated the
woman severely for tempting an honest man on
the “<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Sawbath</span>” day, and told her to go home and
make porridge. For him the jest was doubtless
seasoned by the fact that rigid “Sabbath-keeping”
did not appeal to his tastes, and that he was an
inveterate tea-drinker&mdash;making up for enforced abstinence
while out on the hills by copious draughts at
night. Thus to bring down, as it were, two birds
with one stone&mdash;the rigid Sabbatarians, and those
who trace the degeneracy of the Scottish people to the
substitution of tea for the ancestral porridge&mdash;must
have been a real joy to him. The occasion perhaps
permits of the comment that though a Scotsman, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
was a Scotsman with a difference, and had wandered
too far, alike in mind and in body, to have any intense
attachment to the pattern of the parish pump.</p>

<p>The spring of 1875, which saw him still working
in the Cheviots, brought him his first great honour&mdash;the
fellowship of the Royal Society of London. A
note, undated, written from Morebattle to his future
wife, immediately after he had received the news,
is full of justifiable pride and joy:&mdash;“I suppose I
am the youngest F.R.S. on the roll ... you will
believe me, I know, when I say that I am pleased
as much for your sake as my own, that my work is
recognised. It is no small honour to be elected
F.R.S. out of 57 candidates for the 15 vacancies.”
The note encloses two letters, one from his old
friend and honoured chief, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay, saying:&mdash;“You
came in triumphantly yesterday for the Royal
Society, having the largest number of votes of any
candidate,” and another from Mr H. W. Bristow,
the Director of the Geological Survey of England
and Wales, which shows clearly with what friendly
feeling James Geikie was regarded by his English
colleagues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
<span class="smcap">28 Jermyn St., S.W.</span>,<br />

<p><span class="smcap">My dear James Geikie</span>,&mdash;It gladdens my heart as one of

is also very full of rejoicing, and I only regret that the earliest
announcement of the glad tidings did not reach you from one of
us.&mdash;Believe me, your faithful confrère,</p>

<p class="signed smcap">H. W. Bristow.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>As the Survey work in the Cheviot region was
finished in the year that James Geikie married, his
friend <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay so arranged matters that it was
possible for him to take a house at Perth, which
remained his headquarters for six years after his
marriage, that is until he went to Edinburgh to
take the Chair of Geology.</p>

<p>At Perth Mr and Mrs Geikie made many friends,
and the former threw himself actively into the life
of the place, taking especially a great interest in the
Perthshire Society of Natural Science, of which he
became president later. This brought him into
contact with Sir Thomas Moncrieffe, also at one
time president of the Society; Mr Andrew Coates,
who took a very great interest in the establishment
of the excellent Perth Museum; Dr Buchanan White,
and others. James Geikie also gave courses of
lectures to ladies on geology during his stay in
Perth, and generally did not a little to stimulate an
interest in natural science in the town.</p>

<p>The year 1876 was a very full one. In spring
he paid a short visit to Norfolk and Suffolk to study
some interesting glacial results which his colleague
Mr Skertchly had obtained there. At the same
time he was working at <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>, which
had done so well that a second edition was required.
Under date 27th June he writes to Mr Horne:&mdash;“My
new edition will be out, I expect, in October&mdash;the
first of the season! It is in the printers’ hands
now, and we are settling about the size of page and
type. Printed the same size of type as last, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
volume would be 900 pages, which shows that I
have made some additions!”</p>

<p>At the beginning of July <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay wrote to
ask him if he would be willing to go to Gibraltar
to assist in an investigation of the water-supply
there, the work to count as a piece of Survey duty.
The invitation was promptly accepted, and on
11th September James Geikie left Perth on his
long journey to the South. He stopped a couple of
days in London, and did not finally reach Gibraltar
till 19th September. Here he remained till 25th
October, much longer than he had expected, and
in addition to doing a large amount of geological
work, in what both he and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay found
most oppressive heat, received much kindness and
hospitality from the civil and military officials, and
made many interesting excursions. It was apparently
the first time he had seen subtropical vegetation,
and his letters to his wife are filled with accounts of
all he saw, written in a spirit of almost boyish glee,
and accompanied by much groaning over the heat,
and the resultant thirst. Even bathing afforded
little refreshment, for he says ruefully:&mdash;“Even in
the water one has much the feeling that a herring
must have when it is newly put into a pot upon the
fire. All the springs,” he adds, “yield half-warm
water&mdash;everything indeed is baked, blistered, and
boiled.”</p>

<p>The abundant hospitality, delightful though it
was, naturally took up much time, the hosts perhaps
not fully realising that the two geologists had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
fairly heavy piece of work on hand, and James Geikie
complains that it was difficult even to find time to
write letters to his wife, in the midst of the ceaseless
round of work and pleasure. An interesting fact,
which he does not fail to record, is that at a Mess
dinner at which he and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay were the
guests of honour, the military band played Scotch
music in compliment to their nationality, and among
the airs James Geikie recognised a selection arranged
by his father for a Scotch regiment many years
before.</p>

<p>Among the excursions was included one to the
African coast, where the two made a short stay in
Tangier: the diary, with characteristic orderliness,
records the purchases made here for the people at
home. But in addition to making these, the two
found time to study the geology of the coast between
Ceuta and Cape Spartel.</p>

<p>A letter to Mr Horne, written from Perth on
18th November, not long after his return home,
makes some mention of the tour, and of the other
events of a crowded summer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I heard all about your Shetland work. It did my heart good,
and right glad I am that it has been done by a Survey man....
You would hear about Skertchly’s find. I was down there again
ten days ago at Ramsay’s request, to see the evidence again....
In my new edition, which is out (and selling well!), I go much
more fully into the English Drifts. I got to-day a long letter from
Darwin, along with a copy of his new edition of <cite>Geological
Observations</cite>. His letter is very complimentary, and of course
that is gratifying to me, for I look upon Darwin as a real genius.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my Gibraltar trip very much. Ramsay was very jolly
and in excellent spirits all the time. We did have some fun, I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>tell you. Also we crossed over to Africa and had a run amongst
the Moors. The result of our Survey was so far satisfactory as it
enables us to say very positively what is best to be done in the
matter of the water-supply.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two letters from Darwin about this
date. One has been already quoted (<a href="#Page_27" title="Page 27"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27</a>). In
the other, which is taken up largely with a geological
discussion, he says:&mdash;“Allow me to tell you with
what extreme pleasure and admiration I have just
finished reading your <cite>Great Ice Age</cite>. It seems to
me admirably done and most clear. Interesting as
many chapters are in the history of the world, I
do not think that any one comes nearly to the
glacial period or periods. Though I have steadily
read much on the subject, your book makes the
whole appear almost new to me.”</p>

<p>In this month of November also another sign of
appreciation of his work reached James Geikie in the
offer by the University of St Andrews of its <abbr class="spell_it">LL.D.</abbr>
degree, which was conferred the following year.
About the same time he was approached informally
to know whether he would care to have a knighthood.
This was at this date a much rarer honour than it
became later, and the young couple decided that their
income was not large enough to support it. Very
many years later, after his retirement, James Geikie’s
friends again urged his claims to the title, but the
matter was dropped at the outbreak of the war, and
death came not long after.</p>

<p>Other letters of the same autumn refer to the
“Ice Age,” and to the report upon the Gibraltar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
work. In addition to the <cite>Memoir</cite> upon the question
of the water-supply, a general article on the geology
of the region was contributed to the <cite>Quarterly
Journal of the Geological Society</cite>. Rather curiously,
even at Gibraltar Geikie found evidence of use to him
in connection with his glacial work.</p>

<p>In the early spring of 1877 his eldest son was
born, and the summer saw him wandering about the
Hebrides, of which he sends so racy a description to
his wife that large extracts from the letters may be
given:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
<span class="smcap">Obbe, Harris</span>, <i>7th July 1877</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>This is written out on the hill-side&mdash;I will tell you why
presently. Yesterday we walked from Tarbert, twenty-three miles,
by a wild and lonely track-road, through a desolate and dreary
region&mdash;nothing but bare rock, and a little heather and grass
growing in rocks and crevices. It was all very interesting to me,
however, as every square yard of rock was marked and scored and
smoothed by the great ice-sheet that flowed out from the mainland.
We took our time by the way, making notes and sketches. Every
now and then we passed standing stones and ruins of Picts houses.
At each bend in the track there were always two or three cairns of
stones, which mark the spots where coffins have been rested.
When the Harris folk bury anyone they have to carry the body
often for many miles, as there is only one burial-place for the island.
The poor people must rest by the way, therefore, for refreshment.
Much whisky and <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">kebbocks</span> of cheese and scones go down, and
then they raise a cairn to mark the spot. We met no one all the
way for fourteen miles.... The road wound along the sea coast,
across which we had lovely views to the islets that dot the horizon.
You have no idea of the lovely shades of blue and green and saffron
and orange and gold that streak and flush the sea&mdash;the water is so
clear and crystalline, too, that one feels as if he should like to throw
his knapsack down and take a header! There are few or no houses.
We passed the ruins of several villages, but the poor people were
driven out some forty years ago, and most of them emigrated to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>Canada. I believe they were very unwilling to clear out, and the
soldiers had to be marched upon them. It is very sad to see their
poor huts, all roofless, and grass and nettles growing over them.
As we had much to look at on the road it was nearly ten o’clock
before we came to Obbe, and we passed the inn&mdash;not knowing it.
<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Losh keep us a’</span>, what an inn! It was a mere hut&mdash;just like that
used by the “natives.” There are only two rooms&mdash;a kitchen and
a double-bedded room. The <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">peat-reek</span> circulates freely through
the whole cottage, and the walls are mouldy and damp. We had
a peat fire in our room, and did what we could to make ourselves
jolly. But salt ham is not good to feed on after a long walk.
However, we were satisfied, and after a while got to bed.</p>

<p>To-day we started to climb Roneval, the highest mountain in
South Harris. It has been polished by ice all over, a splendid
confirmation of what I had already described in my book. What
a magnificent view I had from the top! Far away to the west was
St Kilda and the little island of Berneray. Southwards stretched
the various islands of the Outer Hebrides&mdash;North Uist, Benbecula,
South Uist, and Barra. How plainly seen they all were&mdash;high
mountains with broad plains at their feet, over which were dotted
lakes innumerable. In the east, Skye with its wonderful Coolins lay
spread out before us; and north of Skye I could see our old friend
Ben Slioch, and the mountains of Loch Maree and Loch Torridon.
Harris, of course, lay under our feet: and you can form no idea of
its sterile desolation. Endless round-backed hills and rocks,
scraped bare of any soil, and supporting hardly a vestige of
vegetation; great rocky mountains, smoothed and polished all over
and equally bare and desolate, with blue lakelets scattered in
hundreds among the hollows and depressions of the land&mdash;such is
the appearance of Harris. Then there lay the great blue sea
shining like sapphire in the sun, and flecked with tiny sails where
the fishermen are busy at their calling.&mdash;I began this letter outside
to escape the <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">peat-reek</span>, but the midges have driven me in again!</p>

<p class="address_date">
<span class="smcap">Lochmaddy, North Uist</span>,<br />
<i>Tuesday, 10th July 1877</i>.
</p>

<p>We got here yesterday, after a long and very tedious sail in an
open boat. With a good wind we should have crossed the Sound
of Harris in two hours&mdash;instead of which we were nine hours. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>kept dodging about from islet to islet, sighing for a breeze, but no
breeze would come&mdash;what little wind there was being in the wrong
direction. We landed hungry as hawks, or any other animal of
prey, and found a very comfortable inn. Of course we were offered
the usual ham and eggs, but prevailed upon the landlady to give us
fish instead. This place is like the sweepings of creation. It is
made up of irregular bits of land, all jumbled about in a shallow
sea&mdash;or of bits of sea running into the flat land in all directions&mdash;so
that to get to a place one mile in direct distance you may have
to walk five or six or even ten miles, if you can’t get a boat. It is
a land of desolation and dreariness. Bare rocky hills form the
eastern coast, and from the foot of these the low undulating rocky
and peaty land stretches for some ten or twelve miles to the
Atlantic. The land, as I have said, is everywhere intersected by
the sea, and sprinkled with innumerable lakes and peaty tarns.
Along the flat Atlantic coast there are dreary stretches of blown
yellow sands that form hills like those of Barry, near Carnoustie.
Near these are a few huts and a <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">kirk</span> and <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">manse</span>! Not a tree, not
even a bush higher than heather is anywhere to be seen&mdash;peat and
rock and water&mdash;water and rock and peat&mdash;that is North Uist....
I have been vastly pleased with what I have seen, and will have
a lot to tell geologists that is new.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
<span class="smcap">Cairnish, North Uist</span>,<br />
<i>11th July 1877</i>.
</p>

<p>This place is still further out of the world than Lochmaddy.
We walked to it to-day accompanied by one of the Inland Revenue
officers, a very good intelligent fellow, who is quite an antiquarian
and takes an intelligent interest in geology. He knew of me quite
well and had read my “great work.” The road lay for twelve
miles through bogs, morasses, rocks, and lakes, and passed over as
dreary a stretch of country as I ever set eyes on. The sky was cold
grey, and the wind too was none of the kindest. Here we found a
wretched inn, where we were waited on by a great hulking
<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Heeland lassie</span> with a back as broad as a barn door, and bare feet
which haven’t been in a tub since the day she saw the light of this
weary world. She is shy, the dear creature, and has not one word
of English. When I ring for her with the bell that lies on the
table, she looks into the room with a grin on her face. I want salt,
so I take up a bit of the Australian meat and dab it on the side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>the plate. She twigs at once what I want, makes a guttural sound,
and in half-an-hour or so returns with a soap-dish full of dirty salt.
However, she gives us good scones and not bad tea, and strong
<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">peat-reekie</span> whisky. The landlord has been a soldier, I think, for
he speaks of Hyderabad. Fancy a man coming from the sunny
plains of India to this fearful howling wilderness. It would make a
fine penal settlement. You see poor, ragged, dirty women bending
under their <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">creels</span> of peat, and men digging the mosses as for dear
life. It is hard living for them, poor devils. There is no shelter
in the land, even the heather is low and stunted, and the wind
howls in from the Atlantic with a long melancholy sough that is
depressing in the extreme. No sportsman ever comes here, for
there is nothing to shoot. It is said that there are fine trout in the
lakes. It may be so; but the man who could fish such peaty holes
and feel happy in the occupation, could only be an escaped convict
or downright lunatic. The inn at Lochmaddy was snug, if the
country was miserable. Here everything is in keeping.... Most
of the houses are mere stone-and-mud huts with mud floors and
heather roofs. Cattle enter them freely and mingle with the family.
I was amused with an old man who came up to us and asked our
friend the Inland Revenue man what we were doing. He took us
for drovers come to buy cattle. When he heard that we had come
to look at rocks and stones he said&mdash;“We were great fools, and
must be very idle, and light in the head.” And indeed when I
looked round the miserable dreary wilderness I was half inclined
to agree with him. Who but a geologist would ever think of visiting
such a land. Well, it won’t be my fault if I ever revisit the
place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
<span class="smcap">Loch Boisdale</span>, <i>15th July 1877</i>.
</p>

<p>Some days have passed since I last had an opportunity of
writing to you. We have had much walking and no time to write
since we left Cairnish in South Uist. We started from Cairnish
about twelve o’clock on the 11th in a broken-down gig with a one-eyed
horse, which was led or rather pulled along by a native named
Angus Macdougall.... North Uist and Benbecula are separated
by an arm of the sea which is some five miles in breadth, but is so
shallow that at low water it can be forded. What a peculiar scene
it was! A long stretch of mud-flats and sand-banks broken here
and there with reefs of tangle-covered rocks and low green islets on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>which a few black cattle were grazing. Men and women were busy
cutting the tangle for kelp-burning, the smoke of the fires rising
here and there from various points of the dry land on the Benbecula
coast. Heavy drizzle wetted me through and through, and it was
most cheerless. At the opposite side of the ford we reached a
little inn, as dirty and <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">clarty</span> as all the inns are. We now got out
of the trap to walk, as we wished to save the poor horse as much as
possible, for the weary tramp before us. At the pace we went we
calculated we should reach Loch Boisdale about two or three in the
morning. Benbecula is about eight or nine miles in length, and is
perhaps the dreariest bit of land I ever traversed. It is nothing but
a big peat-moss, with a lot of lakes or boggy holes running through
it in all directions. Indeed there is about as much water as land.
Cultivation is a mere parody, everything bespeaks poverty. The
people are as usual haggard and ill-clad, and dirty in the extreme.
Things looked a little better as we got near the shore at Creagorry.
Here our friend Mr Carmichael met us and took us into his house....
It was pleasant to get into a real house again and to sleep in
a clean comfortable bed. Next morning we were up at three
o’clock in order to catch the early ford between Benbecula and
South Uist.... The ford between Benbecula and South Uist is
not nearly so broad as the North Ford, but it is deeper. We got
across about half-past four, and then I got out to walk so that I
might make observations as I went along. It rained heavily for the
first six miles and then cleared off, so that I had time to dry again.
The road goes through much the same kind of scenery as
Benbecula, but there are fine mountains immediately to the left,
and these we gradually neared, and skirted the base of them for
many miles. I saw so much glacial geology that I did not feel in
the least degree fatigued.... As we took our time by the way,
stopping to look at this, that, and t’other thing, it was nearly eight
o’clock when we reached a place called Askernish about six miles or
so from Loch Boisdale.... At five we set off again, and loitering
by the way to chat and smoke and do geology, we did not get into
Loch Boisdale until nine o’clock at night, having been out since
four o’clock in the morning. So off to bed somewhat fagged.
Next morning we were astir by six o’clock and set off in a boat for a
sixteen-miles sail up the east coast to Loch Eynort, intending to
land there and climb Ben More, the highest hill in South Uist. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>was wet and cold, but we determined to go on. The cliffs are
wild and dreary, and fearful places to be wrecked upon, for deep
water runs up to the very rocks. We landed at a place where
Prince Charlie lay in hiding while the King’s cruisers sailed past.
It was a picturesque spot. Wild bare mountains cleft by mountain-torrents
surrounded the small glen, down which leapt a noisy
stream, on the bank of which were one or two thatched cots. The
shepherd came out and asked us to drink milk. It was a
picturesque interior that we were introduced to. There was the
peat fire in the centre, dogs, cocks and hens, cats, and a small pig
crowded round the fire, and the wife and lassies were bustling
about. The spinning-jenny stood in a corner. None of the women
looked well. They were all white and haggard. Carmichael told
me afterwards that they wanted me to prescribe for them, as they
had imagined I was a medical man! Poor things! I could not
help thinking they were consumptive. Yet they all seemed happy
enough, and certainly though I have seen much poverty all through
these islands, yet I have not noticed any of that squalid misery
which is so common in our large towns. The people are poor, but
they always have something to eat. Their wardrobe can’t cost
much, for they make everything themselves, and what they make
seems to last half a lifetime. But to return to the shepherd’s house,
we got our milk and after sitting for a while rose to go. They are
very polite these Highlanders, much more so than most country
folks in the mainland of Scotland. I was only sorry I could not
speak Gaelic, for few of them had more than one or two words of
English. The shepherd told us it had been a bad year for the
sheep, but not so bad, he thought, as it seems to have been on the
mainland. We bade good-bye and sailed into Loch Eynort at a
wild part of the coast, where we landed and dismissed the boatmen
and boat. But mists hung heavy on all the hills, and after much
climbing we were compelled much against our will to give up all
hope of getting to the top of Ben More. However, we managed to
see a good deal, and then struck right across the mountain tract to
the flat ground of the east coast, along which we had walked the
day before. Just before we got down to the road, the mists cleared
away, and the mountain-peak shone brilliantly forth; but it was now
too late to think of climbing Ben More. We had been tramping
over rock and bog and hill and dale for six hours, and we had still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>some twelve miles to walk before reaching Loch Boisdale, and were
reluctantly obliged to abandon Ben More. But I was able nevertheless
to make out all the main geological points that were
important&mdash;so that, after all, we did not lose much.... I shall be
right glad when my face is homeward turned. It is so wet and
dismal it makes one dull whether he will or no. But I have very
much enjoyed my visit, and have gathered material for a great
geological paper, which will bring me much credit, I know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rest of the year 1877 was occupied with
the writing of the Hebrides paper, published in
the following year, and in various geological controversies,
especially in regard to the superficial
deposits of Norfolk and Suffolk. These years at
Perth were thus a period of severe and productive
work, for after long days in the field he would
sit and write far into the night. He kept himself
also carefully abreast of all recent work in his own
subject, and with the help of grammars and dictionaries,
read in the original the papers of all his foreign
confrères, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, etc. The
Norwegian geologist, Dr Amund Helland, afterwards
professor at Christiania, it may be noted, paid a visit
to the house at Perth in 1877, and James Geikie
and he became great friends. A couple of years
later they paid a visit together, an enjoyable and
profitable one, to the Färoe Islands.</p>

<h2 class="chapter" title="Chapter 6. Last Years on the Survey">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="sub_head"><span class="smcap">Last Years on the Survey</span><br />
1878&ndash;1882</span></h2>

<p>The spring of 1878 saw James Geikie engaged in
active correspondence with <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay in regard
to their joint paper on the Gibraltar work, and also
occupied, in his own words, in fighting with wild
beasts at Ephesus and elsewhere, that is to say,
in sundry controversies over glacial matters.</p>

<p>His happiness at home was clouded by the severe
illness of his little son. In his letters he speaks
of being knocked up with night-nursing, for he
walked up and down the greater part of the night
with the child in his arms during the most anxious
period. Happily the baby made a good recovery,
and in a letter to Mr Horne towards the end of the
year he says:&mdash;“‘The boy’ is <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">hale</span> and flourishing,
and a great amusement in the evenings when I come
home. I prefer his company even to that of a pipe!
Excuse the ‘<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">eavy fawther</span>.’” He was very fond
of children at all times, and his own were a source
of great joy to him.</p>

<p>In summer he went back to the Cheviot region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
for a couple of months to finish off his work there,
and revisited Buchtrig. It was during this visit
that he met Sir George Douglas (<i><abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr></i> <a href="#Page_67" title="Page_67"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 67</a>). In
August he went abroad with his wife and her sister,
the baby, now quite recovered, being left with his
grandmother. The tour was <i>via</i> the Rhine to
Switzerland, and then across the St Gothard by
carriage into Italy. Some interesting letters to the
home people record the experiences met with, but
as the ground covered is very well known they need
not be quoted here. During the course of the tour
some geological observations were made bearing
on points treated in <cite>Prehistoric Europe</cite>, which
was being written during this year.</p>

<p>Signs of overwork and some worry were, however,
observable as the year went on. In an undated
letter to Mr Horne he complains of not feeling good
for much:&mdash;“I was busy at a new book, but being in
the blues now for some time, the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> lies aside, and
I sometimes wonder whether I shall ever finish it.
I thought my trip abroad would have cleared up
my faculties, but no such luck!”</p>

<p>Among his causes for anxiety were his own future
and that of the Survey. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay’s health
was breaking down, a fact which grieved James
Geikie very much, and the possibility that difficult
days for the Survey and its members were coming
loomed ahead. In an unwonted fit of melancholy
he says in the same letter:&mdash;“It makes one sad
to think that the ‘brave days of old’ are all passing
or past away. One gets sick of the strife and din<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and wishes for peace and rest, which, however, will
only come when one shuts his eyes for the last time.”
He found also that his distance from a good library
was a great drawback in his work. The letter, with
all its sadness, speaks of the pleasure which he found
in the company of the “small chick,” who seems
to have had a potent charm wherewith to dispel
his father’s clouds of gloom.</p>

<p>Among the letters of the spring of 1879 are
several to Mr Lamplugh, now of the Geological
Survey. In regard to these Mr Lamplugh says:&mdash;“I
do not know that they contain anything that
is now of sufficient consequence to warrant their
reproduction. But they illustrate very well the kindly
attention and trouble that the late <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie
was always ready to give to a beginner in science.
I was under twenty years of age when the first of
these letters came to me, and I have kept them
as treasures from those days.”</p>

<p>The letters in their friendliness and unaffectedness
bear out this description, and some other letters
of the same period show that while the writer was
never deaf to the appeal of a common interest in the
progress of knowledge, when to this was added the
stronger appeal of friendship, he gave himself whole-heartedly.
His friends Messrs Peach and Horne
had written a paper on “The Glaciation of the
Shetland Islands” for the Geological Society of
London, and in this James Geikie took the keenest
interest, giving advice freely both on the method
of presenting the contents, and on the technical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
points connected with the effort to obtain for the
paper a fair hearing and speedy publication. A
hitch in the matter of publication brings from him
a letter full of genuine and practical sympathy,
combined with a whole-hearted espousal of his friends’
cause.</p>

<p>During this spring also he was still engaged,
with varying fortunes, upon his <cite>Prehistoric Europe</cite>,
a task of great magnitude on account of the enormous
number of references and the labour which these
involved. Thus a letter written early in March
represents, as it were, the trough of the wave&mdash;he
tires of the book at intervals, thinking it will never
do, and throws it aside in a “<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">kind o’ scunner</span>.”
Another letter at the end of May shows him on
the crest of a new wave of enthusiasm. He had just
received many new pamphlets from “<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">furrin’</span> parts,”
mostly inspired by his own glacial work, often
accompanied by letters from the authors. Thus
he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Dr A. Penck of Leipzig writes to the effect that it was the
reading of <cite>Great Ice Age</cite> that first opened his eyes to the meaning
of the Diluvium of Northern Germany. He says he has got
evidence of three glaciations with intervening glacial deposits!
He says he has all the burning enthusiasm of a convert! His
letter has greatly gratified me, of course. I see he is an old hand
and has done a lot of geological work. Then I have a long letter
from a Dr R. Lehmann of Halle, who is also congratulatory at the
success with which the German Drifts have recently been explained
on the principles laid down in my book!! Also, some duffers have
sent me their photographs! I wonder what has so suddenly wakened
them up. Helland has a long and interesting paper on the German
Drift which I suppose you will see: also a batch of papers on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>same subject from <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Berendt of Berlin. I don’t know how I
am to get through all the Swedish and Norwegian papers I have
received. They are so hard to read.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A postscript to this letter says:&mdash;“Pray excuse
the exulting egotism of this epistle. I would not
write so to anyone else.”</p>

<p>But while glacial work was thus occupying most
of his attention, lighter subjects were not altogether
forgotten. In another letter to Mr Horne, written
on Good Friday, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In a few days I am going to ask you to do me a favour, which
is to run your eye over some <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> I shall send you. You need not
read it all through&mdash;that would be too much of a good thing&mdash;but
just dip into it here and there, and see what it is like. You will
laugh when I tell you that the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> is poetry, translations from the
German. These have been lying beside me for some ten or twelve
years. I was urged by several friends of good judgment to publish
them long ago. But I would not be induced to do so, so I laid them
aside until I had quite forgotten them and could read them and
criticise them as if they had been the lucubrations of another man.
They bore this better than I expected, and I gathered together all
I could find and have had them copied out and stitched into a
volume.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is perhaps needless to say that this <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> was
the translation of Heine’s poems, of which mention
has already been made here repeatedly. The
intention to publish at this time was abandoned,
partly because of the possible effect on the “new
book,” i.e., <cite>Prehistoric Europe</cite>.</p>

<p>During this spring James Geikie was also
corresponding with Dr Helland on glacial topics,
and had arranged to accompany him to the Färoe
Islands, to study the glacial phenomena there. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
start was made at the end of May, and the two
spent a delightful time together, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Helland’s
knowledge of the language being a great help.
James Geikie’s paper on his observations was
published a year or two later, and his note-books
contain long descriptions of his experiences, with
many sketches and diagrams. A more informal
account is given in a letter to Mrs Johnston of
Crailing Hall:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I enjoyed my trip very much though I had to rough it more
than most people would care to do. But what I saw was quite
enough to make me forget all discomforts. Perhaps the most
striking features of the Färoe Islands are their sea-cliffs. These
range in height from 300 feet to 2000 feet. I sailed in a little boat
round a large part of the coast-line and was very much impressed.
The cliffs rise sheer up out of deep water, seeming in some places
almost to overhang. Fancy the sun shining brightly on a great
wall of brown rock 2000 feet high&mdash;a wall which shows an infinite
number of little shelves and ledges, and all these ledges thickly
set with sea-birds in myriads, while the air is filled with them,
wheeling and screaming above you, and the water is alive with
them swimming, diving, floating, and capering! The great Atlantic
rollers come smoothly up to the base of the cliffs and sweep into
the caves, only to rush out again with a hoarse roar, and a wild
splash of spray and broken water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not very long after his return from the Färoes,
at the end of July, his second son was born.</p>

<p>Several letters from <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay, on the Färoes
work and other subjects, in the course of the
summer show the friendly terms upon which the two
were. Thus in announcing that he (Ramsay) had
been chosen President of the British Association for
the Swansea meeting in 1880, he adds:&mdash;“And unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
you write the Presidential Address for me, I will take
steps to have you dismissed from the Survey!”
Unfortunately for James Geikie, the time during
which Ramsay had anything to say upon Survey
matters was fast drawing to a close. A few days
later Ramsay writes in jubilant spirits because their
joint work at Gibraltar had proved correct, although
certain borings had seemed at first to cast doubt upon
some of their conclusions. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay’s feelings
in the matter are expressed as follows:&mdash;“Ho ho ho!
Ha ha ha! also he he he!” In the same letter
Ramsay speaks of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Penck’s results, saying:&mdash;“It
is a grand coup for you.”</p>

<p>Among James Geikie’s other correspondents this
summer were <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Stevenson of New York, a very
warm friend of later years after the two had met in
the flesh, and Mr T. F. Jamieson, who like Ramsay
was greatly interested in the Färoes work. Towards
the end of the year he writes to Mr Horne:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have recently got heaps of new facts from Germany, France,
and Austria, not to mention Italy, which will greatly aid me in
working off my present book. That same book drags its slow
length along, but I hope to finish it in time for publication
next year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After giving a general sketch of the contents of
the book he goes on:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My references to foreign writers will astonish you with their
“learned profundity”&mdash;what do you think of Italian, Greek,
Spanish, Austrian, German, Hungarian, French, Danish, Dutch,
Russian, Swedish, Norwegian, and Icelandic references! The time
I have spent over these with grammar and dictionary, and the
trouble in having others translated for me by learned pundits, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>such that I will never, I think, undertake anything of the kind again.
Sometimes two or three long nights’ work is summed up in a short
line; or even has no mention at all! I only hope the result will
justify the time expended. It is all intensely interesting, however.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it may be well to repeat in connection
with this letter that this laborious work was the
occupation of what should have been leisure hours,
and that in addition to it James Geikie was putting
in some eight or nine hours’ work per day in the field
or at office work, was carrying on an extensive
correspondence, was lecturing in various parts of
Scotland, and was writing scientific papers. Much
of his writing had thus to be done by curtailing the
hours of sleep, and most of those who came into close
contact with him at this time regarded his capacity
for work as something almost superhuman. But
despite his heavy labours, this year seems to have
been a happy one, and perhaps helped him to bear
the period of storm and stress which was to come.</p>

<p>The chief incident of the following year, 1880, was
the completion and publication of <cite>Prehistoric Europe</cite>,
and the letters are full of allusions to it. Thus
towards the end of January he writes to Mr
Horne:&mdash;“Still grinding away at my tome. Got
about a third to write yet. The thing swells out,
I am sorry to say; there is so much more to tell than
I had any idea of.” The severity of the strain was,
however, obviously telling upon him, for only a week
or two later he says:&mdash;“All at present is at a standstill.
My head has given up work, and I must leave
it alone a little: been going at it early and late too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
much!” A little later he says again:&mdash;“I am going
to rest and do nothing but read. You have no idea
what a loathing one takes to paper and pen sometimes!
But doubtless you have the same.”</p>

<p>It was nearly the end of July before the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr>
was finally completed, and the nature of the effort
is indicated by the fact that the concluding sentences
of the book were written in his sleep! He was
working at it as usual till far into the night, and could
not find a fitting sentence to round off the whole.
After trying for some time ineffectively, he decided to
leave the matter till the morning, and went off to
bed, the time being 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> In his usual orderly
fashion he had placed the last sheets on his writing-table,
putting two books on top to prevent the papers
from being scattered by a chance draught. In the
morning he found them scattered over the table, to
his great disgust, for it was a stern household regulation
that papers were <i>taboo</i> for all hands save their
owner’s. The maid when taxed, however, denied
indignantly that she had touched them, and when the
injured author gathered up his treasures he was
astonished to find, written in his own handwriting,
though not with his usual neatness, the sentence
which now stands as the final one. Evidently he had
dropped to sleep and come down to complete the
unfinished task in a subconscious condition. The
story shows clearly that it was time the book was
done with.</p>

<p>But the labour did not cease with the completion
of the <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> The holiday, which began early in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
August, was spent partly in London, looking up final
references, and partly in South Wales, with a view to
making out some further glacial points. A letter to
Mr Horne suggests the mixed feelings which the
completion of the task brought. He says:&mdash;“I am
well pleased now to have the thing off my hands.
I will not soon begin another such work. It is too
much worry and labour&mdash;and yet pleasant withal.”
Later he writes:&mdash;“Now that my book is off my
hands, time in the evenings hangs heavy on my
hands”&mdash;the Nemesis, a psychologist would say, of
overwork, for it was obviously the condition when
nothing but work had become possible!</p>

<p>Various pleasant little incidents, however, occurred
this autumn. Thus the French geologists, <abbr title="Messieurs" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">MM.</abbr>
Falsan and Chantre, sent him a copy of their
Monograph on the old glaciers of the Rhone basin.
In sending the book M. Falsan spoke with gratifying
warmth of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>, and of the many new
ideas which he and his confrère had obtained from its
perusal. “I feel as if I shall get cocky,” says James
Geikie in a letter, “and, as pride goes before a fall,
am beginning to dread lest <cite>Prehistoric Europe</cite> should
be damned.” M. Falsan also asked permission to
translate <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite> into French, and there
were German offers to translate both <cite>The Great Ice
Age</cite> and <cite>Prehistoric Europe</cite>.</p>

<p>The latter appeared towards the end of November.
Copies were sent, among others, to Charles Darwin
and to Prof. Ramsay, whose letters in reply were a
source of great gratification to James Geikie. Darwin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
wrote both immediately upon receipt, and later after he
had read the book. In the second letter he says:&mdash;“Yours
is a grand book, and I thank you heartily for
the instruction and pleasure it has given me.” That
this was not mere flattery is apparent from the keen
discussion of certain special points in which he was
interested.</p>

<p>The next year, 1881, was one of great stress,
though the tale of its external events is soon told.
That <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay’s health was failing had long
been known, and though his actual resignation did
not take place till the end of 1881, the fact that it
was impending was obvious long before. It was also
known among the Survey men that his retiral would
mean extensive changes, likely to affect directly and
indirectly most of the members of the staff. As has
been already stated, it led to James Geikie’s resignation
and his acceptance of the professorship at
Edinburgh University. Something must therefore
be said in regard to the reasons that induced him
to leave highly congenial work for a post which was
not, certainly at first, wholly so, and which further,
at least in early days, did not materially improve his
financial position.</p>

<p>It must be noted first that by this time he was
the author of two bulky books (produced, as we have
seen, at the cost of great and continuous toil) which
had been hailed at home and abroad as “epoch-making.”
He had correspondents in most parts of
the civilised world; men of mark in their own
countries had publicly acknowledged him as a leader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of geological thought, a fount of inspiration, an
opener up of new paths of research. At the same
time, to those immediately above him he was a
subordinate, with a very moderate salary, a recipient
of orders, with little opportunity for initiating changes
or improvements, and was living in a small provincial
town, to some extent remote from the main current of
public life.</p>

<p>Second, and this is a point which is much less
familiar to the general public than in a democratic
country it ought to be, his books were not of the
kind which bring direct monetary reward to their
author. His family was increasing, for his third son
was born in this year of 1881; he himself was past
forty, and the probability that he could continue to
go on working for many years more at the rate
at which he had been toiling during the last twenty
was necessarily diminishing. Now it is universally
admitted, as a general proposition, that when a man
without private means has done and is doing important
and highly specialised work for his country and
for the world, work which does not bring direct
pecuniary gain, then it is the duty of those in high
places to see that he be established in such a position
as to free him from financial anxiety for the future, to
enable him to face his responsibilities with a calm
mind, to obviate the necessity for his wasting his
strength and intellect in hack-work in order to
supplement his income. But, while this is admitted
as a general proposition, there is always the possibility
that petty personal interests will intervene in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
particular case. James Geikie left the Survey partly
under the pressure of such interests, which seemed to
threaten his prospects of immediate promotion, and
partly under that of friends who thought that the
professorship offered more scope for him. Whether
he was right or wrong it is difficult to say, but there
is evidence that at least at first he regretted his
decision. He might have quitted the Survey of his
own free will, and would certainly have done this with
a pang, but the thought that his decision to leave
was not wholly voluntary, made the pang excessively
bitter.</p>

<p>Many of the letters of this year of anxiety are too
intimate to be quoted. We shall only insert sentences
and phrases to make the narrative plain.</p>

<p>One of the first indications of coming events was
an attack upon <cite>Prehistoric Europe</cite> in the early part
of 1881, an attack which it seems quite clear was not
motived wholly by an honest desire to promote the
cause of science. It was this element which made
the matter so hard to bear.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The affair has affected me more than I can tell.... You will
laugh, but it is true all the same, that I can hardly eat or sleep.
For the attack itself I don’t mind, I know that my book is a bit of
honest true work, and will outlive the attempts ... to stifle it....
I wish the snow would go and let me out to have a walk. Sometimes
I wish that I had kept clear of writing books altogether....
I remember wondering once when Green told me that when he was
vexed with anything a romp with his <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">bairns</span> made him quite hearty.
It seemed to me overstrained. I don’t think so now that I have
<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">bairns</span> of my own. Their quaint and funny ways quite carry you
out of yourself.... Dearly as I love life, I can already foresee that
the time will come when I shall be glad to lie down and sleep the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>sleep that knows no waking.... Verily I do believe a good wife
and loving mother is the only treasure of treasures that is worth
striving for in this world!... How much you and I have to be
thankful for!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are a few extracts written to his friend Mr
Horne at the moment when the history of the
incident was just becoming plain, and at a time also
when Mr Horne’s first child had just been born; they
throw perhaps more light upon it and upon the
character of James Geikie than any ordered narrative
could do.</p>

<p>Later letters of the same spring emphasise the
effect which the incident had upon him. “The whole
thing,” he writes in one letter, “has worried me more
than I can tell;” but a journey south, where, <i>inter alia</i>,
he lectured at Hull, and led a big geological excursion,
helped to change the current of his thoughts,
while his reception at Hull gratified him greatly.
Fresh letters from continental geologists also, not
only praising his book but discussing the bearing of
his results upon their observations in various parts
of Europe, must have helped to assure him that it
was worth while to do honest work, despite detractors.
Further, the family moved from Perth to Birnam,
where they took a charming cottage at the foot of
Birnam Hill, covered with roses, and with a large
untidy garden. The early summer was brilliantly
fine, and the fresh air and open life of the country
must have made it easier to take a more philosophical
view of the affair, unpleasant as it was.</p>

<p>The letters of early summer show at least a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
perceptible recovery of balance and cheerfulness.
His third son was born in June, and in answer to
congratulations he says:&mdash;“A <em>third</em> boy was a great
disappointment&mdash;a girl would have ‘completed’ all
the family any reasonable man could desire!”</p>

<p>The arrival of the baby prevented him from
accompanying Dr Helland on a projected trip to
Iceland in early summer, but, rather curiously,
an opportunity to visit the island occurred a little
later in the same year, for he went to report on some
sulphur mines.</p>

<p>On 17th September he writes to Mr Horne:&mdash;“I
have just returned from Iceland, where I have
had some very hard but very interesting work.
What a country! Fancy me riding eleven hours
over lava-beds, mountains, etc., devil a road or even
path! However, all was fresh and new.”</p>

<p>By this time the question of changes in the Survey
was becoming acute, and James Geikie was beginning
to debate with himself as to whether he ought to
try for the Chair in Geology at Edinburgh for his
children’s sake. The indecision he found very
unsettling. “I can settle to nothing&mdash;reading and
writing are alike out of the question.” More than
a month later he writes:&mdash;“I am pulled two ways&mdash;my
own desire and wish is to remain in the Survey.”
“My repugnance to that Chair,” he says a few days
later, “increases as the days go past.”</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing, however, shows better his fundamental
repugnance to all the weighing of questions
of worldly advantage, to the scheming and plotting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and wire-pulling which go to the making of appointments,
than a letter written to Mr Horne in the
thick of the conflict. This begins with an account
of information which had reached him in regard
to the position of affairs as to the Edinburgh Chair,
and glides off insensibly into an account of letters
just received from <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Penck and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Gandry,
the one a German and the other a French geologist.
Both letters contained much of great interest to him,
and the letter becomes a full discussion of the points
raised, the question of his own future meantime
sinking entirely out of mind.</p>

<p>Obviously he wanted to be let alone and allowed
to do his work in peace, to have reasonable security
for his children. In one letter he laments his own
lack of worldly wisdom, and his willingness to take
advice from his various friends; and the rather
pathetic balancing of the advantages of one apparently
possible position against another, merely
meant that his mind was set on other things
altogether, and that in consequence he allowed
himself to be swayed by the different influences
brought to bear upon him. His own candour and
frankness made him singularly willing to accept advice
offered under the guise of friendship, without stopping
to investigate the question whether his advisers were
or were not wholly disinterested. But his unwillingness
to be separated from his old colleagues remains
the dominant note, even when he yielded to what
seemed sound arguments brought to bear upon him.
His instant response to kindliness is shown by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
following quotation:&mdash;“Isn’t old Ramsay a trump.
He wrote me a short, but such an affectionate letter
that I declare I could not read it without wet eyes.”</p>

<p>His final decision to apply for the Chair was due
to the receipt of a private letter which informed him
that the Home Office was prepared to appoint him
immediately on his sending in an application, on the
ground that he was the man obviously best fitted for
the post. It was also indicated to him informally
that the reputation which he had obtained owing
to his books was such that any other testimonial
was unnecessary. Inquiries had been made which
had satisfied the Home Office that no other possible
candidate had such high qualifications for the post.
In announcing to his friend Mr Horne the receipt
of this flattering though unofficial letter, James Geikie
cannot forbear adding:&mdash;“I shall quit the Survey
dead against my desires. But yet I feel I am doing
best for myself and for my children.”</p>

<p>Both his natural modesty, and perhaps the painful
memory of his controversy in the spring, made him
uneasy about the fact that the appointment was made
without, as he says, any chance being given to other
possible candidates. Thus he forwarded the unasked-for
testimonials, the writers including all the leading
men of the day in his own branch of science. But
amidst all the bustle of arranging about the testimonials,
and about the leaving of his work and the
finding of a house in Edinburgh, the note of regret
recurs constantly. “I can’t realise that I am leaving
the Survey. How vexed I am&mdash;no one can tell.”</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
<p>Not all his own regrets, however, could quench
his enthusiasm for the service he was giving up.
Thus he took up cudgels with the utmost vigour
for his friends on the Survey, whose interests he
thought likely to be affected by certain proposed
changes. These changes he thought regrettable not
only on this account, but also because they seemed to
him contrary to the interests of the whole Survey.</p>

<p>His new work at Edinburgh was not to begin till
the autumn of 1882, and though the house in Edinburgh
was taken in spring, the family stayed on
in the country all summer, partly to let the new-made
professor finish off his Survey work, and partly
that all might enjoy the country air. But the
respite did not ease the pain of the prospective
parting:&mdash;“It makes me sad at heart when I
think that the old Survey days are for me so soon
to end. So life wags&mdash;some day soon I shall be
ending work for good and all, and then for a long
rest, and no heartaches and no headaches. My
heart gets heavy whiles at the thought of leaving
the green fields over which I have wandered so long
and happily. After forty years of life it is almost
too late to change. But what I have done I hope
will turn out for the best. Anyhow, I hope you
fellows will not forget the old comradeship, but come
often and see me. I can’t yet realise that I am
leaving work in the field, and going into town to
become fat, greasy, and respectable.” And so the
summer months slipped away, and autumn brought
Edinburgh and the new sphere.</p>

<h2 class="chapter" title="Chapter 7. Edinburgh and the Professorship">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="sub_head"><span class="smcap">Edinburgh and the Professorship</span><br />
1882&ndash;1888</span></h2>

<p>Official work in Edinburgh began with the delivery
by the new professor of his inaugural address on
27th October 1882, the subject being “The Aims and
Methods of Geological Inquiry.”</p>

<p>In early days the class was small, and as the
income derived from Sir Roderick Murchison’s
endowment was supplemented by the students’ fees,
then paid direct to the professor, their number was
an important matter. Further, at the time of the
appointment, as for many years later, geology was
not compulsory for any degree, and was not even
an optional degree for the ordinary course in Arts.
This meant that the professor had not a status in the
University comparable to that of those of the Arts
professors whose courses were compulsory, or of
the members of the Medical Faculty. On the other
hand, it meant that the students who took the
class did so from a genuine interest in the subject.
The fact that <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie soon acquired much
weight in the Senate was due entirely to his strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
personality, unassisted, at least at first, by any
advantages of position.</p>

<p>The letters of this first winter session are filled,
as might be expected, with the business of settling
down in Edinburgh, the buying of furniture and
carpets, the “grind” of getting up the lectures,
and recurring regrets at parting with old friends.
A letter to Mr Horne, written at the beginning
of January 1883, illustrates very clearly the dawning
of genuine interest in the new work, still mingled with
longings for the old. The following passages may be
quoted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I was at the office the other day.... But how the days flash
by. And how the dear old days are gone when you and I and
the others used to chaff and make a noise o’ winter in that office.
It makes me melancholy sometimes when I think of it all. I am
Professor in Edinburgh University, but my heart is in the Survey
with my old Survey chums. Here are tall hats, black coats,
pompous windbags&mdash;and in a word, starch and humbug. My
boy, I have been caught too old. Had I come here earlier I might
have become “respectable” too&mdash;but it is too late! However,
I get on well with my students who, being young, understand fun
and such improvised nonsense as I endeavour to cheer them with.
I fancy some of my colleagues would have their hair elevated if
they heard me. I like the work much better than I expected, but
eh man! I miss the freedom of the country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The office alluded to above was, of course, the
Survey Office, and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s colleagues record
that at first he found it difficult to keep away from it.
He generally dropped in on his way to or from the
University to see how things were getting on, and
never missed an opportunity of meeting his old
friends. When he began to have students’ parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
some of the Survey men were generally asked also,
so that the students might have an opportunity of
coming into direct contact with the men who were
making geology in Scotland.</p>

<p>Many allusions in the early letters show that the
new professor found the task of arranging his class
work irksome. In certain branches of geology he
had himself taken little interest, having specialised
early, and as at first he had no assistant, all the
work fell on his own shoulders. For microscopic
work and some aspects of mineralogy he had always
expressed contempt, as being only suitable for the
men who could not or did not work in the field; and
these despised subjects he now felt himself constrained
to “get up” for class purposes, and this necessity
drew from him many groans. One must admit that
there was a certain tragedy in this taking of a man
of forty-four off his own highly specialised work to
grind up a subject of practically no use to him in
that work; but such tragedies are frequent when
original thinkers are placed in professorial chairs
which demand much elementary teaching. Preparing
for his microscopic class, he complains, means sitting
up half the night, and is “fiddling work,” requiring
little in the way of brains.</p>

<p>A letter to <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Stevenson of New York, dated
26th January 1883, is not without interest in the same
connection, in showing the effect of this drudgery on
his own work. In acknowledging one of the former’s
publications, he says:&mdash;“I am sorry I have no papers
to send you. My preparations for a new start as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
professor in our University here have absorbed nearly
all my leisure time, so that several papers I had
chalked out have been laid aside for the present.”
A letter to Mr Horne, written a few weeks later,
while the author was invigilating a class examination,
shows where his thoughts turned as soon as the
strain was lifted for a moment. It records the receipt
of a letter from <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Nathorst of Stockholm, who
had been doing work in Spitsbergen, and had come
independently to the same conclusion in regard to
certain points as James Geikie. The latter adds:&mdash;“He
says he is delighted that his conclusions, arrived
at independently, should corroborate and support
mine. Very nice.”</p>

<p>The same letter to Mr Horne contains an allusion
to an odd form of compliment which had just reached
the writer. A lady in Nova Scotia, apparently a
total stranger, had written to ask if the author of
<cite>The Great Ice Age</cite> would stand godfather to her
baby. The cream of the jest was, however, that
the said baby was not expected to enter this vale
of tears till some three or four months after the date
of the letter. History, unfortunately, does not record
whether or not the infant put in an appearance, nor
whether it had to be baptised as James or Jamesina,
but the professor gave his consent without, as
he says, any ungentlemanly reference to common
proverbs.</p>

<p>At the close of this, his first winter session,
the new professor took a party of students on a long
geological excursion to the Border district, his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
hunting-ground. During the course of the excursion,
which lasted several days, the party visited Buchtrig,
whether wholly from geological or partly from sentimental
reasons does not appear. Some fine tramps
were taken over the hills, and the fact that the
leader had himself worked out the geology of the
district must have added much zest to the excursion.</p>

<p>In May the first summer class in geology was
held, this being one of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> James Geikie’s innovations.
It was well attended, twenty-six students
taking part, and consisted of both indoor work and
excursions. After this year this summer course
became a part of the regular routine, and while it
was a great improvement from the point of view
of teaching, it naturally still further diminished the
professor’s spare time, and placed him at a disadvantage,
so far as independent work was concerned,
with his colleagues of the Arts Faculty who then
had only a short winter session.</p>

<p>The summer holiday was spent at Largo in
Fife, and the summer was clouded by the death of
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s father, who passed away at the age
of seventy-three, having seen both his geologist sons
established in positions of importance.</p>

<p>The work of the following session, 1883&ndash;1884,
proved easier than the first, “but just yet the Chair
is not a ‘bed of roses.’ It takes up more time than
I had reckoned for.”</p>

<p>Spring brought two distractions, the Tercentenary
celebrations of Edinburgh University, and preparations
for a visit to Canada and the United States in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
connection with the British Association meeting at
Montreal. Of the former <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie soon wearied,
and voiced his weariness, and perhaps some remains
of resentment in regard to those winter nights spent&mdash;fruitlessly
from his point of view&mdash;in “getting-up”
uncongenial subjects, in a series of verses. These at
the time were shown only to privileged friends, but
may be quoted here now for the sake of those who
can see a joke, even if it is partly at their own
expense. They make it clear that the author was
not yet wholly reconciled to academic life.</p>

<p>The spring brought also the offer of the honorary
fellowship of the Geological Society of Stockholm.</p>

<p>In August he started for New York, this being
his first journey across the Atlantic. He enjoyed the
voyage very much, being one of the very few
passengers who were able to appear at meals during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
a stormy period met with soon after leaving Ireland.
Later the weather improved and the party became
very lively, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie participating in all the
entertainments and gaiety which went on. “I feel
already 20 per cent. better in mind and body,” he
says; “twenty years younger am I too, or I would
not enjoy such high jinks as go on here.” Several
friends were made on the ship, and one of these,
a Boston gentleman, showed much kindness to <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Geikie on his arrival in New York. Thanks to him,
it was possible to see something of the city during
a brief stay there, the incidents including a visit
behind the scenes of a theatre, where the stage
manager announced that he had read <cite>The Great
Ice Age</cite>.</p>

<p>From New York the journey was continued to
Chicago, which did not make a very favourable
impression, and on to St Paul, much of geological
interest being seen <i>en route</i>. From St Paul the party
went to Winnipeg, the furthest point west reached.
The crossing of the prairies made a great impression
on <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie. He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have often pictured the prairies to myself, but somehow the
picture never comes up to the reality. How strange it is to gaze
over a seemingly limitless extent of grass-land as flat as any Scottish
<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">haugh-land</span>. The sky was exquisitely bright&mdash;white clouds sailing
over a delicate blue&mdash;but the colours of the prairie surpass my
powers of description. The wild flowers fairly took my breath
away&mdash;there were blues, purples, whites, and yellows, the latter
predominating. Standing outside of the car one never tired
watching the changing hues&mdash;here were broad belts of yellow,
there patches of blue and white and purple. Or all the colours
were commingled in a dazzling confusion. The rails are laid flat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>on the prairie and the sweet flowers grow up to the rails. Butterflies
in absolute clouds&mdash;great big fellows&mdash;danced and flitted about,
and now and again a flight of birds appeared. But huts or houses
were seen only at very wide intervals&mdash;sometimes many miles were
passed without any sign of human habitation. I enjoyed the ride
of 500 miles through the prairies much more than anything else
I have yet seen. It was a new experience. What an expressive
silence seemed to overhang the vast stretch of grass-land. A heavy
storm of rain and sheet lightning suddenly came on and drove us
into the car at sunset. When I woke this morning at four o’clock
and looked out of the carriage window I saw an exquisite sunrise&mdash;a
beautiful pink flushed all the east, and the prairie fairly gleamed
with golden yellow and blue.</p>

<p>The notes on Winnipeg and on the journey
thence to Toronto are interesting as showing how
little future developments were expected at this date.
Of Winnipeg, described as being “in the far west,”
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie says:&mdash;“Winnipeg is a surprising
place for so far distant a region. Here are some
25,000 inhabitants: it is quite a considerable town&mdash;with
churches, theatres, etc., etc., and a Scientific
Society.” Speaking of his journey eastwards he
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We left Winnipeg on Wednesday (20th) and travelled all day
through rough rolling ground, very rocky and sprinkled with my
friends&mdash;boulder-clay, morainic gravel and sand, and large erratics.
The country was upon the whole rather dreary, dense thickets of
spruce fir covering the rocky knolls, and swamps and morasses lying
in the hollows. Here and there where the ground was more open
the prairie flowers flourished, and butterflies and dragon-flies fluttered
and darted about in the sunshine. Night overtook us while we
were still in the same monotonous country. A number of British
<abbr title="Association">Ass.</abbr> folk had joined us at Winnipeg, among them <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ramsay,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4" /><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
a nephew of <em>my</em> <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> R. The night we passed in the sleeping-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>car,
and next morning found us still sweeping along through the
same kind of forest land. Very fine evidence of ice-work was seen
all the way&mdash;just like what I know in Wester Ross and Sutherland.
We breakfasted at a rough station in those dreary backwoods.
Houses are few and far apart in such a desolate region, and I can’t
see how the railway can ever pay. We passed over 1000 miles of
land, most of which seemed to me as barren and hopeless as the
poorest tracts of the Outer Hebrides. The trees are small miserable
sticks, and everywhere one sees rising above these small trees tall
ragged and naked trunks, marked with fire, showing that much
forest land must have been destroyed by fire in earlier days.
We stopped at last at Port Arthur, at the upper end of Lake
Superior, where we spent the day and night. This is a small
backwoods town of some 2000 or 3000 inhabitants. The view over
Thunder Bay is fine, and I enjoyed a walk into the country.</p>

  </div>
</div>
<p>Next day the party sailed down the lakes to
Owen Sound and took train for Toronto. From
here Niagara was visited, and after that the journey
continued to Montreal.</p>

<p>From Montreal <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie went south to
Philadelphia, where he found the heat very trying,
and then back to New York and on to Boston. The
latter town attracted him greatly. “I feel more at
home in Boston than I have felt since leaving <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Auld
Reekie</span>. The people are more like our own people
too.” Here he met and made many friends, and tells
an amusing experience with a German lady doctor,
who made wine from grapes grown in her own
vineries. She and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie got on very well
together, and the latter was invited to visit the
vineries and taste the wine. Having received a
private warning, the professor resolved to display
extreme abstemiousness when confronted with the
fluid, but the lady ceremoniously proposed the health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of her guest from across the seas, who felt constrained
to return the compliment with a brimming goblet.
Fortunately the proceedings came to a close soon
afterwards, and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie and his friend were able
to hurry home to the latter’s house in order to correct
the influence of the concoction with a modest “dram.”
They took a long drive afterwards, and no results
followed, apparently, beyond the acquisition of a
conviction that the climate of Boston was unsuited to
the juice of the grape.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie returned home,
and in December he writes to Mr Horne bemoaning
the amount of work which he found waiting for him.
He says:&mdash;“But know one thing, O Horne, that here
in <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Auld Reekie</span> I am pestered to death with correspondence.
People scribble on all sorts of subjects,
and expect answers, and I begin to hate the sight of
notepaper. And so the letters that I ought to write
and like to write remain unwritten, while those I
detest to write take up more time than I like to
waste. You should have seen the piles waiting for
me on my return from Yankee land&mdash;some of the
rubbish is not answered yet.” He goes on in the
same letter to say:&mdash;“I find living in town more
expensive than the country, there are so many calls
upon one, and the class does not pay as well as I
had hoped. But that is mending and I have good
hopes.” He also speaks of a “pot-boiler” he was
busy with, to wit, his <cite>Outlines of Geology</cite>, which
though far advanced at this time did not appear till
more than a year afterwards.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>

<p>The same note occurs in other letters of the
following year, and a projected visit to the Hebrides
in the summer of 1885 had to be given up owing to
“circumstances over which I have no control (<i>i.e.</i>,
empty purse).” “Living here is not so easy as in
the country,” he adds again. But he also says:&mdash;“I
have got into the ways of my new sphere and jog
along very comfortably.”</p>

<p>More interesting than the “pot-boiling” of which
he speaks frequently, was his work in connection with
the Scottish Geographical Society, in which he took
an active part in the autumn of 1884. Thus in the
letter already quoted he says:&mdash;“I have been <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">sair
taigled</span> with that Geographical Society, but I think
it will do; and I mean to work it to some purpose.
We are going to bring out the first number of a
Geographical Magazine in January, for which I have
promised to write a short article on the Physical
Features of Scotland.”</p>

<p>At the first meeting of the Royal Scottish
Geographical Society, it may be noted, which was
held on 28th October 1884, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie moved&mdash;“That
this meeting, recognising the scientific and
general utility of a national society for the promotion
of geography, resolves that a Geographical Society
for Scotland be now formed.” He was associated
with the Society till his death, and took a very active
part in its management, as Hon. Editor from 1888
onward, as a Vice-President, and for the period
1904&ndash;1910 as President. Beginning with the first
number also he made frequent contributions to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
<cite>Scottish Geographical Magazine</cite>, contributions of
great scientific importance, and in addition was
always ready to put his knowledge and experience at
the disposal of the Acting Editor. During a long
period of years his work for the Society must have
made large inroads upon his time and energy, and
thus geography in Scotland, no less than geology,
owes him a great debt of gratitude.</p>

<p>No very noteworthy events took place in the year
1885. The <cite>Outlines of Geology</cite> was finished, though
it did not appear till after the New Year, and in
autumn a visit was paid to Louisa, Lady Ashburton,
who became a great friend of the family. The visit
was to Lady Ashburton’s country house at Loch
Luichart in Ross, and was very enjoyable, many
drives being taken to surrounding places. On the
homeward journey <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> and Mrs Geikie stayed with
their friends Mr and Mrs Horne at Inverness.</p>

<p>The party at Loch Luichart was evidently a very
gay one, and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie, freed from strain and at
leisure, seems to have been full of life. Letters from
members of the party, written on receipt of Heine’s
<cite>Songs and Lyrics</cite>, which saw the light in the autumn of
1887, are full of allusions to the visit and to the songs
that had been sung during the drives, allusions which
cast a pleasant light on the geologist’s human side.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1886 the <cite>Outlines of Geology</cite>
appeared, and was so successful that a second edition
was called for less than two years afterwards.
During 1886 also <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s fourth son was born.</p>

<p>As the year went on, signs of strain due to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
process of adjustment to the conditions of town life
began to make themselves apparent, one of the most
distressing symptoms being insomnia. A sleeping-draught
which gave five or six hours of sleep was
welcomed with a fervour which tells a pitiful tale.
Perhaps in some ways even more serious for one
who was lecturing daily was loss of voice, which
occurred at Christmas. The brief vacation failed to
produce permanent improvement, and the early part
of the year 1887 saw a losing struggle between ill-health
and James Geikie’s strong sense of duty. As
soon as the spring vacation freed him he went off
to the Canary Islands to recuperate. A letter from
Teneriffe, dated 18th April 1887, indicates a characteristically
rapid rebound of spirits:&mdash;“This place is
a paradise on earth!” The hotel (at Orotava) he
describes as “simply fairy-like. It is bowered in
trees, palms and others. Fountains and lakes are
all round, lovely gardens one blaze of gorgeous colour,
and rich green, cool colonnades with lounges where
you can sit and dream and gaze on the sunlit sea.
The mornings and evenings are simply heavenly.”</p>

<p>During his stay <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie climbed the Peak on
foot, an exhausting excursion in the heat, and one for
which he was probably not fit. His account of the
effect of rising above the mountains noontide cloud-cap
is interesting:&mdash;“When we got above the clouds
the sight was very grand. The upper surface is
approximately level, and, rising above it, the higher
ridges and mountains look so many islands in a
tumbled and rolling sea. But such a sea! Imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the sun blazing down from a perfectly clear and
cloudless sky&mdash;the mountain tops rugged and serrated,
and coloured red and yellow&mdash;and the cloud-sea
shining with the most silvery brilliance. Now and
again the wind would cause the clouds to rise up
like billows and roll for some little distance up the
hill-slopes above the general level of the cloud-sea,
but the invading billows were soon torn to shreds and
disappeared.” Of the top he says:&mdash;“What a weird
scene it was. Here were numerous extinct volcanoes,
craters looking raw and red just as if they had
vomited forth yesterday. The ground was sprinkled
all round with slags and cinders and volcanic sand
and dust, and not a blade of grass was to be seen.”</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie did a certain amount of geologising
during his stay in the Canaries, and said in his letters
home that he was greatly the better for his trip:&mdash;“My
voice is as strong as ever, and I feel braced up
in every way.” Unfortunately the improvement did
not last after his return home. He had a disappointing
summer, and with winter the insomnia returned.
He could do little save his class work, and this was a
sore struggle. But the fact of his being cut off from
his own special work had the effect of turning his
attention again to the German poems, and the book,
as stated, finally appeared in the autumn of 1887. A
good many of the letters acknowledging receipt have
been preserved, for the poems had always been very
dear to him. A pathetic letter from Lady Ramsay
records the pleasure which the book gave to Sir
Andrew Ramsay, now an invalid and sadly changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
from what he had been in his prime. She had read
some of the verses to him as he sat in his bath-chair
at Beaumaris, where the family were now living, and
they had brought back some flashes of his old
animation.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s health continued to give cause for
anxiety throughout the winter of 1887&ndash;1888, and in
summer he and Mrs Geikie went to the Engadine, in
the hope that the high altitude and bracing air would
do him good. As the weather became colder they
went down into Italy, coming home eventually by sea
from Naples. Some charming letters to the boys,
who were left at home, and to others of the family
connection, have been preserved, but deal for the most
part only with the usual incidents of travel in the
Alps. “The boys” were by this time old enough to
be keenly interested in butterflies, and their father
gives some humorous descriptions of his attempts to
increase their collections.</p>

<p>Among the minor incidents of the tour were a
meeting with Huxley at the Maloja, and the delivery
by <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie of a lecture on the Ice Age at
Pontresina to an audience of two to three hundred
people. The latter part of the visit to the Engadine
was marred by the cold, and the altitude did not seem
to suit him so well as he had hoped. On the journey
through Italy a stop was made on Lake Como, of
which <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie speaks with the same enthusiasm
as of old. On the whole, the tour seems to have
been very beneficial, and to have been an important
factor in restoring him to health.</p>

1889&ndash;1903</span></h2>

<p>At the beginning of 1889 <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie was awarded
the Murchison medal of the Geological Society of
London, “in acknowledgment of his important
contributions to the geology of North Britain, and
especially of his investigation of glacial phenomena.”
A letter of cordial congratulation from his old
friend Mr Whitaker on the award speaks of the
writer’s own debt to the author, and of his adoption
of a number of the latter’s conclusions. In this
year also he was made a D.C.L. of Durham
University.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption_attribute">[<i>Photo by Elliott &amp; Fry.</i></p>
<p class="caption"><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie at the Age of Sixty.</p>

<p>At this time <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie had added to his university
work proper a course for women, who were
as yet excluded from classes within the building.
At the end of the course, in the spring of 1890, he
took the members of the class on a long excursion to
Birnam, to give them an insight into field geology.
The party was a gay one, and their doings were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>celebrated by the leader in a series of verses, of
which the first runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">Of the Geologic Class</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Sing the glorious days’ renown</div>

    <div class="p_line_i2">Prepared to pound to sand</div>
    <div class="p_line_i8">All the rocks.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s muse was also active the same
summer at the dinner of the Edinburgh Royal Society
Club, held in honour of Dr Nansen’s return from
Greenland, where he sang a song of his own composition
which met with a great reception. Its <i>motif</i>
was the joys of Greenland as a place remote from
civilisation, and a lament over the fact that, except
for that happy land, “<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">the hale round world is
tounifeed</span>.”</p>

<p>In this year also he was President of the Geological
Section at the Newcastle-on-Tyne meeting of the
British Association, and devoted his presidential
address to the subject of “Glacial Geology.”</p>

<p>In 1891 he returned to America, this time to
deliver a course of lectures at the Lowell Institute
in Boston. This gave him an opportunity to renew
many pleasant friendships made during his previous
visit, but his stay was somewhat marred by an attack
of influenza. Among his papers are many notes
of invitation and greeting, an interesting one being
from <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> William James, which contains careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
instructions as to how the host’s house might be
found, accompanied by a sketch-map.</p>

<p>The following year saw the publication of an
important paper “On the Glacial Succession in
Europe,” in regard to which the author says, in a
letter to his friend <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Stevenson of New York:&mdash;“I
sincerely believe that the conclusions will stand,
no matter how extravagant they may now appear
to be.” This year also he was President of Section
E (Geography) at the Edinburgh meeting of the
British Association, the subject of his presidential
address being the “Geographical Development of
Coast-lines.” Among the foreign guests at this
meeting was the Norwegian botanist, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Blytt,
who writes to thank him “most heartily for all your
great kindness to me during my stay in your beautiful
city.”</p>

<p>By this time <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s university work
had considerably increased, for in 1891 he had been
elected Convener of the Science Degrees Committee,
and, after a Faculty of Science had been instituted
by the Royal Universities Commission in 1894,
he was elected Dean of the Faculty, a post which
he held till a year before his retirement from the
professorship. This brought him into contact with
all the science students, and gave him much to do
in the way of organising and arranging courses.
As a result his feeling of strangeness to university
life seems to have passed away entirely, and he
became thoroughly absorbed in the life of the
institution. The work of the Universities Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>mission
also greatly improved the status of his
subject, and his position as Dean gave him much
influence in moulding the policy of the University
in regard to scientific education. A series of verses,
apparently never published, but written in support
of an appeal for more funds for university purposes,
adopts a very different note from the earlier verses
which we have quoted, and show that too much
stress should not be laid upon those as representing
more than a passing mood.</p>

<p>In 1893, in addition to various papers, a volume
of collected essays and addresses was published as
<cite>Fragments of Earth Lore</cite>. But this must have
been merely a piece of byplay, as it were, for during
1892 and 1893 the laborious task of bringing
<cite>The Great Ice Age</cite> up to date was being carried
on. Thus on 29th January 1893 he writes to <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Chamberlin of Chicago, saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have been busy of late in completing a new edition of my
<cite>Great Ice Age</cite>. So long a time has passed since the publication of
the last edition that I have found it necessary to rewrite the book.
The labour of boiling down the evidence obtained by the geologists
of Scandinavia, Russia, France, New Zealand, Italy, Spain, etc.,
has been very great, and has rather taken it out of me, so that for
the present I am compelled to lay my <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> aside and do nothing!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the interval of rest can only have been brief,
for he writes again on 12th March, saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am again slowly working at my book, in hope that I may have it
in the printer’s hands by the end of summer.... I have been
truly astonished to find that the voluminous materials which have been
collected during the last seventeen years in Europe, group themselves
without the least difficulty into a coherent and intelligible whole.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>Until I had tabulated the results I was hardly prepared to find that
the evidence from all parts of Europe tallied so closely. Each bit
of the puzzle seems to drop into its place with ease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hope expressed in this letter was not fulfilled,
for nearly a year later, on 20th January 1894, we find
him writing again to <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Chamberlin, saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the course of week or two I hope to complete my new edition
of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>. The revision has given me more trouble
than I expected, chiefly on account of the large number of foreign
papers which I have had to read and digest, for I was anxious to
exhaust the evidence as far as I could....</p>

<p>I am hoping to put the manuscript in the printer’s hands by the
end of March or middle of April. I give myself that additional
time, for I wish to take another look at some of the deposits on the
Baltic coast lands before finally parting with my <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> As soon as
I get rid of my College duties I shall start on my flying visit to
Denmark, etc. Some very remarkable evidence has turned up
recently in Tasmania and Australia. Geologists will have to
reconsider their notions as to glaciation of our Antipodes in the
light of the newly discovered evidence. I much wish that I had
a long purse, unlimited time at my disposal, and a younger earthly
tabernacle, for under those happy conditions I should sail straight
away for the South, to see what I could see.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Chamberlin was supplying a sketch of the
glacial phenomena of North America, which forms
Chapters <abbr title="41">XLI.</abbr> and <abbr title="42">XLII.</abbr> of the completed book, and
the correspondence between the two went on during
the greater part of this year, for the book was not
published till autumn.</p>

<p>On 4th May he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have just returned from a few weeks’ holiday in the Baltic
coast lands of North Germany and Denmark, where I had another
opportunity of studying the great moraines of the Baltic Glacier....
I am quite ready for press&mdash;all the maps are engraved&mdash;and am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>most anxious to have the book set up and corrected for press before
the end of July. I shall probably go abroad then: and it would be
impossible to revise proofs away from my library.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the summer <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie had a visit from his
friend <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Stevenson of New York. In an undated
letter to the latter, apparently written in early
summer, arranging details about the visit, he
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am sorry to hear about the nervousness. Having had it
myself&mdash;for three years&mdash;I know what it means. But, courage!
<i>mon ami</i>, with care you can stave off the enemy. The beast has
been threatening me again for some months past. But the work
which caused him to look in upon me, with his infernal grin, is now
all but finished. In a fortnight I shall be a free man! Then
geology may go hang till winter. I wish I had a long sail across
the briny again, to Fiji or anywhere out of the busy haunts
of man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The summer holiday was spent at Traquair on
the Tweed, and in a letter to Sir George Douglas
written from there on 10th August, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I had thought at one time of going to the Continent, but here
it is more restful and that is what I wish. I have no news of any
kind, but am happy to say that I have at last escaped from the
printer’s devil. My <i>Penelope’s Web</i> is out of my hands at last: and
I shall do nothing for the next month or two save loaf about
the hills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But as always there were delays at the last, and
a month later he writes to thank <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Chamberlin
for some additional notes, saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The notes were quite in time to be inserted in the proofs. The
book will not be “out” before October. The engravers have kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>us back a little; but it is no joke revising the proofs of 850
pages.... You may be sure that an early copy of my book will be
sent to you as soon as I can get it out of the publisher’s hands.
I am sorry, however, that it is so big. I did what I could in the
way of compression; but there is so much new to tell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the autumn a very pleasant incident occurred,
and as it is recorded in letters sent to <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Chamberlin, they may be permitted to tell the
tale:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date"><i>19th Oct 1894.</i></p>

<p>A short time ago I had a most gratifying letter from the
Glacialists’ Excursion-party of the Geological Congress. The party
(thirty in number) embraced some of the best known European
glacialists, and was under the guidance of Penck, Brückner, and
Du Pasquier. They went over the sections showing the glacial
succession in the Alpine Lands, and were convinced that Penck’s
interpretation of the facts were correct. In short, they admit that
there have been at least three separate glacial epochs, and each
separated from the other by long-continued valley-erosion during
interglacial times. The letter sent to me was signed by all the
excursionists. The evidence, indeed, is so striking that one
wonders that Alpine geologists should have been so tardy in
recognising it!
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p class="address_date"><i>29th <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 1894.</i></p>

<p>I do not think there would be any impropriety in publishing the
letter I received from the glacialists, and you are welcome to use it
for the <cite>Journal</cite> if you think it worth while. The import of the
letter appeared in some German newspapers at the time; but
I never thought of publishing it here. Yet I see no reason why it
should not appear in your <cite>Journal</cite><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5" /><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;only, I may be accused of
personal vanity in sending it to you. But there is really no
vain-glory in the matter, all that the writers say is simply that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
I would be pleased to see that they had studied the evidence
adduced by Penck, Brückner, and Du Pasquier, and were convinced
that the Alps had been glaciated three times. I therefore enclose
a copy of the letter, the signatures being copied exactly as they are
given. You will see the list includes some of the best known
glacialists of Europe.</p>

<p>The third edition of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite> duly
appeared in the autumn of 1894, and some extracts
from a letter written by <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Stevenson may help to
show the impression produced on a fellow-worker
by the contemplation of the toil involved. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Stevenson says, under date 30th May 1895:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have been working away over your <cite>Ice Age</cite>. It is a wonder
you were not frozen solid during the work. Collation and
comparison of observations upon the American <abbr title="Carboniferous">Carb.</abbr><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6" /><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> are bad
enough, but the conflicts are as nothing compared with those
with which you have had to deal. I can well imagine that [you]
felt as you penned the last chapter as Captain Marryat did once,
when he closed the title of his last chapter with “And the author
says ‘Thank God.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="footnotes">
  <div class="footnote">

  <p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6" /><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> That is the Carboniferous beds of North America, the work
  upon which <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Stevenson was himself engaged.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>The next few years were passed in the usual
round of writing and teaching. In 1896 a third
edition of the <cite>Outlines of Geology</cite> appeared, and in
1898 a number of lectures and papers were collected
together in book form as <cite>Earth Sculpture, or the
Origin of Land-forms</cite>, which ran through several
editions.</p>

<p>In 1897 the Edinburgh Royal Society Club entertained
Dr Nansen to dinner on his return from the
<i>Fram</i> expedition, and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie, who was always
the life of such gatherings, sang a song of his own
composition which was greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Among the letters of these years, which include
many to American and continental friends, is one
to <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Stevenson from which the following passages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>as representing a considered opinion, may be
quoted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is certainly a pity that the men who can work and would fain
devote themselves to original investigation, are often prevented
doing so by the necessities of life. I am not so sure, however, that
some of them would do work if they were placed in an independent
position.... I’m much afraid that man on the whole is a lazy
beast, and needs some kind of whip or bribe to make him live
laborious days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the course of 1900 <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie had
a pretty compliment paid to him from across the
Atlantic. On his first journey across he made
the acquaintance of Mr Louis Elson, a professor
of music at Boston. The friendship so begun was
kept up in later years, and Mr Elson dedicated one
of his books, <cite>Shakespeare in Music</cite>, to “<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> James
Geikie, <abbr class="spell_it">LL.D.</abbr>, D.C.L., of Edinburgh University, with
cordial remembrance of many pleasant conferences
on this and kindred topics.” Another American
recognition of his work was the naming by the
U.S. Geological Survey of Mount Geikie, in the
Wind River range of the Rocky Mountains in
Wyoming, in his honour. The mountain reaches
a height of 12,546 feet. The information has been
kindly supplied by Mr J. G. Bruce of the Forest
Service, Lander, Wyoming.</p>

<p>In the spring of this year <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie made
a tour with a friend to the Pyrenees, a tour which
made a great impression upon him, and seems to
have been an unqualified success. Some charming
letters to his wife describe incidents of the journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the letters, like all similar family correspondence,
being full of regrets that no members of his own
household accompanied him. Though the visit
was made very early in the season, in the month
of April, and the snow still lay deep in the high
valleys, the weather was almost perfect, and the
two friends took many long excursions. Among
these was one to St Bertrand de Cominges, which
attracted <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie strongly. In a letter written
from Luchon to Mrs Geikie in regard to it he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yesterday we had a most interesting excursion to see an old
fortified mediæval cathedral town. You would have enjoyed
it. It was quaint and picturesque beyond measure. Evidently,
now, cathedral and town are in a backwater&mdash;the flood of life
has long gone past them. The church, however, contains magnificent
wood-carving of the 13th century. It was the kind of town of
which one sometimes dreams&mdash;hardly a town, but a sleepy village
perched on a high rock with a wide outlook over the lowlands, and a
grand view of the snow-capped mountains to the south. I saw one
old house&mdash;or the top of it, rather&mdash;was for sale. It had quaint
dormer windows and corbel gables, and was shut off from the narrow
street by a high gate of weather-worn carved oak, hundreds of years
old. I was tempted to buy it&mdash;when you and I tired of the world
we could retreat to the seclusion of that sleepy old village, and
dream the days away. The sun was as usual blazing from
a cloudless sky, and as I leaned over the old battlements of the
wall I could see that the wall from top to base was aflare with
wallflowers and other plants, while mosses, ferns, and lichens were
everywhere, every stone encrusted with moss and every crevice
of the masonry stocked with flowers, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same letter he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Walking in the scorching heat is most fatiguing. I had over
twenty miles of such walking the other day, and will not repeat the
experience. All the same I delight in the blaze&mdash;the heat and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>lightness seem to penetrate your skin and work their way to your
very vitals. How one’s blood courses! and how the old youthful
feelings come back!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another passage from a later letter, written from
Argelès, may be quoted, less for its description than
for the light it casts upon the character of its author.
It may be noted that by this time he was the father
of the much longed-for “<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">wee lassie</span>,” who had been
born a few years before. He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">wee lassies</span> are most delightful to look at. Many of them,
as I have already mentioned, are little beauties. Such sweet,
demure, kissable wee things they are, with their hair neatly done
up, and hanging down in a plait behind. They are all bare-headed
and all are dark. Brown to black hair, with soft liquid brown
eyes, rich red lips, and a rosy flush in their tawny faces.... In
years to come I will often dream of the <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">bonny wee</span> toddlers I
stopped on the road to pet and fondle in these beautiful valleys.
R. was as much struck as I with the children. But as I have my
own <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">wee lassie</span> in my thoughts, he probably did not feel his heart
in his mouth and his eyes water as the wee ones passed us on
the road.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To these letters, written during the trip, may be
added some extracts from one written to a member
of the family circle after his return home. On
29th May he writes from Edinburgh:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Since my return from France I have been driven from post to
pillar, doing my best to clear off arrears. Now I am in a way
“<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">redd up</span>,” and able to look round.... I feel quite rejuvenated
with my trip.... I saw much that was very interesting to me as
a geologist and much also that was beautiful, so that my memory
is now stored with a fresh series of lovely visions&mdash;of picturesque
and quaint people.... I have looked out one or two places to
which some day I hope to take Mary and (if my purse is long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>enough) the <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">wee lassie</span>&mdash;that is when she is bigger! But half my
life has been spent in dreams and plans for the future, and <em>some</em>
only of these have been realised.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The letter goes on to speak of that great May
function in Edinburgh, the Commissioner’s garden-party.
Mrs Geikie and their eldest son were to go
to this&mdash;“Stewart will go as ‘Professor Geikie.’
The professor himself can’t be induced to go, and
(as this is a holiday for him at college) he is taking
Mary Dorothea out to Mortonhall Golf Club-house
for afternoon tea. The young lady has been looking
forward to this treat ever since I came home.”</p>

<p>The identity of the “young lady” will perhaps
be apparent without explanation.</p>

<p>In 1901 <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie was made an Honorary
Member of the New York Academy of Sciences,
his name having been brought up by his friend
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Stevenson. In writing to thank the latter
he speaks of his hope of being again able to visit
America, saying that as soon as “my lads clear
out from the nest, it will be easier for Mrs Geikie
and me to go off on a long holiday.” The future
careers of his sons were at this time occupying a
large share of his thoughts, for the three elder boys
were ready to begin life on their own account.</p>

<p>He had a few years before taken to bicycling, and
was full of the pleasure and health he found in the
exercise. During this year also his friend, Mr Elson
of Boston, paid the family a visit at Beauly during
the summer holiday, a visit of which Mr Elson speaks
with both enthusiasm and gratitude in later letters.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>

<p>The next year or two repeat the same tale of work
and play, the latter including much bicycling, and a
visit to Norway in 1903. In 1903 he writes to his
eldest son:&mdash;“To-day I am sixty-four, and feel no older
than I was twenty years ago. Indeed I am younger
than I was four or five years ago.” Of work it need
only be said that new editions of two of his
books appeared in these years, <cite>Earth Sculpture</cite> in
1902, and <cite>Outlines of Geology</cite> (fourth edition) in
1903. Mention of an entirely new book may be
reserved for the next chapter. A pleasant little
incident of the summer of 1903 was a postcard
from the Glacialists’ Excursion of the International
Geological Congress, who sent, from Telfs in Tyrol,
“Greetings and best wishes to the Nestor of Glacial
Geology.” Such greetings were a frequent and
always a pleasant experience.</p>

<span class="sub_head"><span class="smcap">Retirement from the Professorship
and Last Days</span><br />
1904&ndash;1915</span></h2>

<p>During 1904 <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie began to suffer from an
affection of the knee which troubled him for some
years, and proved to be a form of rheumatism. In
October he writes to his son telling him of the
progress of his new book, which was published the
next year as <cite>Structural and Field Geology for
Students</cite>, and in a few years’ time ran into a second
edition. With his usual optimism he hoped to have
it out early in the New Year, if not before, but by the
following April he was still busy with proofs, and
publication did not occur till June. Writing in
April he says:&mdash;“The last sheet of my book will
be off to the printer to-morrow, and the book itself
will, I hope, appear before the end of the month.
I shall feel like a fish out of water with no scribbling
on hand. Nothing like it for filling up vacant hours.”
When writing this letter he was on the eve of
starting off for a visit to Ayr, in the hope that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
course of bicycling would “supple” the leg. In
this, however, he was disappointed, and in summer
he and Mrs Geikie went to Wildbad in Würtemberg,
where he hoped to find a cure.</p>

<p>The baths, temporarily at least, did him much
good, but his fellow-patients, mostly of German
nationality, did not please him, and his letters are
full of humorous complaints in regard to them.
He was keenly interested also in the nature of the
water, being convinced that its curative properties
were not due to the constituents apparent on analysis
but to some of the rarer elements, such as radium,
present though undetected. The suggestion has
been made and confirmed in regard to other waters
since, but his keenness on the problem is of interest
as showing that there was no failure of mental power.
His letters to his doctor son on the physiological
effects of the waters are full of his old <i>verve</i> and
clearness of exposition. Characteristically, however,
he breaks off the scientific discussion to speak of the
“fat Fraus and Herren,” whom he and his wife daily
watch “as they slowly waddle and roll to and fro”
near the Trinkhalle. His impressions he sums up
in the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">The typical Frau, to my British mind,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Is preposterous in front and prodigious behind:</div>
    <div class="p_line">Her digestion is sound&mdash;for, ’tis very clear,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Her grub she dissolves in an ocean of beer.</div>
    <div class="p_line">Her lord, who is equally round and obese,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Rolls along by her side, with a grunt and a wheeze&mdash;</div>
    <div class="p_line">Rolls along, did I say?&mdash;they do not roll far,</div>
    <div class="p_line">But rotate within reasonable reach of a bar.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>With perhaps some recollection of his early studies
of Heine, he takes eye measurements of the average
German lady, and winds up with a vivid description
of an ordinary German’s meal, and a disgusted&mdash;“But
the most of these people are gross eaters.”</p>

<p>During 1906, as indeed until his death, he was
carrying on a constant correspondence with <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Stevenson of New York, in which many questions&mdash;geological,
social, political, personal, and so forth&mdash;came
up for discussion. Thus in January 1906 he
says, speaking of his sons and their careers:&mdash;“All
the birds are out of our nest now, all save one
<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">wee lassie</span> who remains to brighten our hearts with
laughter and song.” By this time his eldest son was
established in a practice at Ayr, the next two were
working as mining engineers in Borneo, and the
youngest was studying music in Germany.</p>

<p>During this year the rheumatic knee still troubled
him, and a visit to Harrogate to try the waters there
did not produce much permanent benefit. The
summer was spent in Ayrshire, but was saddened by
the sudden death of a favourite niece, who had been
almost a daughter of the house during the long years
when the family consisted only of boys, and was on
holiday with her uncle and aunt at the time of the
acute illness which caused her death.</p>

<p>In 1907 his eldest son was married, and there is
a charming letter written to him on his wedding tour,
with much wise advice about matrimony, mingled with
personal experiences. Among other things the writer
says:&mdash;“When I went on my honeymoon I took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
geological hammer with me, but the geology did not
count for much. I think the hammer was used
chiefly for digging up roots and ferns for your mother,
or for knocking off bits of rock that were covered
with gay lichens.” The young couple had gone to
Devonshire, and this sent the father back to Herrick,
and that writer’s description of “dull Devonshire.”</p>

<p>In the autumn <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie had the pleasure of
meeting <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Stevenson of New York, who came
to London for the Centenary Celebration of the
Geological Society there. At the end of November
he writes to his eldest son, saying:&mdash;“My work at
College is easy this winter, for I feel in much better
health than I have done for two or three years. My
lameness is practically cured, and I begin to think
that I may yet be able to go with May to her first
ball, and dance a reel with the nicest-looking girl in
the room&mdash;as usual.”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1908 <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> and Mrs Geikie and
their daughter, together with a niece, went to
Portugal, which they all enjoyed greatly. In the
early part of this year also the first grandchild, a
little girl, was born. Another event of the year was
the translation of <cite>Structural Geology</cite> into French.</p>

<p>The correspondence with <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Stevenson was still
going on, and there was an interesting letter from the
latter in August. He was contemplating retiral from
his professorship, while <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie had no wish to
give up his own post, and the two discussed the
question of the desirable age for the event. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Stevenson wished to have leisure to complete some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
private work of his own, and his letter contains the
following interesting passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You were a fortunate man: you struck out into an unexplored
field and you lived to correct your own errors. Yours became the
monumental monograph on the Glacial period: the volume is in
all libraries and it never can be ignored safely by even the shrewdest
and most unscrupulous of borrowers. A merciful Providence
directed your steps toward a problem of world-wide interest. Your
great-grandchildren will see your work quoted in all standard
treatises. Like the rest of us you have brought many loads of
bricks for the geological edifice, but, unlike most of us, you have
shared in the work of construction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The summer of this year was spent at an east
coast watering-place, where the weather was wet and
cold. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie was frankly bored, and expresses
himself in a letter to his eldest son with a vividness
which will appeal to all who have had a similar
experience. The letter is long&mdash;its composition was
doubtless the occupation of a hopelessly bad day&mdash;and
we shall quote only some extracts:&mdash;“Our rooms
are so small we are constantly tumbling over each
other and gnashing our teeth at each other.... I
have got to loathe that beach, and to hate the sound
of the waves, and the smells of the village, and the
raucous voices of the natives and their sluttish ways.
I have been reading a very interesting book upon
the cemeteries of Etruria. Some of the painted
sepulchres must be quite cheerful, and I really think
if one could hire such a tomb for the summer it would
be better than taking a house in Caledonia stern and
wild. Of course we should only sleep in the sepulchre&mdash;a
good lamp would give all the light required.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
We should select one on a hill-side near to which no
motors could possibly come, quiet and retired, with
only sheep and cattle for our neighbours.... From
the doorway of the tomb we could feast our eyes on
unrivalled scenery, bask in the sun, scent the soft
zephyrs with the aroma of tobacco, and envy no man....
The geology would interest me, but what I
would chiefly enjoy would be blue skies, warm sunshine,
absence of whirlwinds and tornadoes, with
none of that blighting easterly <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">haar</span>. No wonder the
majority of Scotsmen are Calvinists and Radicals&mdash;their
country is enough to make them that&mdash;and
worse, if it were possible.”</p>

<p>A little later in the letter, however, he admits to
having had one really good day, when he and Mrs
Geikie made an excursion together:&mdash;“We had a
bag loaded up with grub, kettle, teapot, spirit lamp,
etc., the weight of which was not inconsiderable. I
would have dropped it, but your mother was so happy
with the prospect of tea by the sad seashore, that
my heart melted within me. (I must say, however,
that my whole body was in a melting condition before
we got back.)”</p>

<p>In 1909 his second grandchild was born, another
girl, which brings from the grandfather the remark:&mdash;“Girls
are far the nicest, especially when a father
gets old and wants some one to bring him his slippers,
or to fill and light his pipe. Boys are of no use in a
family; they only make noises, damage the furniture,
harass their mothers&mdash;and, in short, they are the very
devil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>”
Writing in March to his son, he returns to the
question of his resignation, saying:&mdash;“For myself, I
don’t feel like resigning just yet! I can walk like any
other Christian, and enjoy my work as much as ever:
and my class keeps up its numbers.”</p>

<p>In the summer he had an invitation to go to
Boston to be present at the inauguration of Dr
Abbott Lawrence Lowell as President of Harvard
University, and at the same time to deliver another
series of lectures at the Lowell Institute in Boston.
He refused the invitation, however, though with
regret, for he shrank from the long voyage across the
Atlantic. Another pleasant incident of the year was
the publication of Profs. Penck and Brückner’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die
Alpen im Eiszeitalter</cite>, which was dedicated to
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">James Geikie, dem Verfasser von <cite lang="en" xml:lang="en">The Great Ice
Age</cite>, dem Landsmann von John Playfair</span>.”</p>

<p>One of the two authors of the book, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Penck
of Berlin, was, as has been indicated here, an old
friend of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s. The two first met in 1883,
and, as we have already stated, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Penck had
repeatedly acknowledged his scientific debt to the
author of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>, while there was a
personal tie in addition. In 1914 <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Penck received
the Gold Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical
Society, and was <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s guest at the time
when the presentation was made.</p>

<p>In the summer of that fateful year, however, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Penck was one of the foreign guests at the Australian
meeting of the British Association, and was in
Australia at the outbreak of war. In the opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of his hosts, his behaviour, in an admittedly difficult
situation, lacked the perfect “correctness” which was
desirable, and this both in Australia and on the
homeward journey. Some indiscretions in the way
of sketching and photographing in the vicinity of
military works led to his being detained for a time
in London on his return. During this period he
corresponded with <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie on geological matters.
After the latter’s death he wrote to Mrs Geikie from
Germany a letter which, in spite of the circumstances
indicated above, and in spite also of certain phrases
which jar, cannot be regarded as anything but sincere.
We quote from it the following passages, which form
a notable tribute. The letter, it should be stated,
was written in English:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>James Geikie belongs to those who have influenced most my
scientific evolution. His clear way of seeing things and his
reasoning made a convincing impression on me, and though I never
listened to one of his lectures, I felt always to be one of his students.
He was my master. His <cite>Great Ice Age</cite> showed me the ways to
understand the glacial deposits of Central Europe: his <cite>Prehistoric
Europe</cite> arose my interest for prehistoric questions: his views on
mountains, valleys and lakes gave me the base for my morphological
work. He made me also acquainted with English and Scotch, with
the life on the other side of the Channel, with English poetry, for
he was a poet himself. And now he is dead, and he died in the
year of the great war, which breaks the strongest links between our
peoples.</p>

<p>I am not superstitious and I do not lay stress on this coincidence
of facts. I hope what I believe he would hope too, that the
struggle of the nations will have one day its end, and that peace
will come again which unites the different nations for great scientific
works. But while the peoples are still fighting, I must express my
heartiest sympathy to my old friend’s wife.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>Returning to the chronological order of events in
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s last years, we find that the year 1910
was an unfortunate one, for he had a sharp attack
of pneumonia in the spring. From this he made
eventually a wonderful recovery, but the process was
somewhat slow. Before his illness he had begun the
book which was published in 1913 as <cite>Mountains:
their Origin, Growth, and Decay</cite>, but his health, and
the time it took to collect the beautiful illustrations,
delayed its appearance. A letter from his brother,
Sir Archibald, in September 1910 to Mrs Geikie
speaks of his wonderful recovery, and goes on to
say:&mdash;“I hope he won’t overtax his strength at
College. With so splendid an installation for the
Geological Department the temptation to do so must
be great. I don’t know of any college or university
that is better fitted out for geological teaching than
Edinburgh now is.”</p>

<p>In this year <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie retired from the presidentship
of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society,
and his retiral was the occasion of the presentation of
his portrait, painted by Mr A. E. Walton, R.S.A., to
the Society, a replica being at the same time given
to Mrs Geikie. The ceremony of unveiling took
place in the Society’s Rooms on 7th November 1911,
when <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s old friend and colleague, Dr John
Horne, gave a short address on the scientific career
of the original of the portrait.</p>

<p>It may be noted here that the fact that Dr Horne
had for many years been living in Edinburgh explains
the absence of letters in later years, for personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
intercourse had taken the place of correspondence.
Dr Horne retired from the Geological Survey in
this year of 1911, and in a letter to <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Stevenson,
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie speaks of a dinner given to him by
present and former colleagues on the occasion of his
retiral. Writing in March, he says:&mdash;“Last night Dr
Horne (<abbr title="Geological">Geol.</abbr> Survey) was entertained by his present
and former colleagues. My brother, wonderfully hale
and hearty, was in the Chair. Horne retires from
the Survey in June. It seems a short time ago when
he first started work in the Survey as a lad under
my guidance. But upon reflection I see the ‘short
time’ = 44 years! When I think of it, old age seems
to have come upon me all at once.”</p>

<p>Other incidents of 1911 were a spring holiday in
Devonshire and a summer one in Switzerland, while
in autumn <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> and Mrs Geikie were at the
Centenary celebrations at St Andrews University.
Of these, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie sends a lively description to his
daughter. He enjoyed the proceedings very much
on the whole, but found many of the meetings and
entertainments too long for his taste and strength.
Of one dinner he complains that the speakers “not
only exhausted time but encroached upon eternity.”</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year, now that the
question of resignation was beginning to demand an
early decision, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie resolved to present to the
University the large collection of books and pamphlets
which he and his brother Sir Archibald had made for
the use of the students of the geological classes. A
letter from the Secretary of the University Court,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
written at the close of December, says:&mdash;“The Court
desires me to communicate to you, and through you
to your brother, Sir Archibald, in conjunction with
whom this valuable collection of scientific works
was made, their most cordial thanks. The loyalty
to ‘Alma Mater,’ on the part of Sir Archibald
and yourself, has been warmly appreciated by the
Court.”</p>

<p>The chief incident of 1912 was a visit to London
to take part in the celebrations of the 250th
anniversary of the Royal Society, of which his
brother, Sir Archibald, was president. In the following
year <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie was elected President of the
Royal Society of Edinburgh, an honour of which he
was very proud. He held this position while his
brother was still President of the London Society&mdash;a
somewhat remarkable coincidence. In writing to
congratulate him on the appointment, Sir Archibald
says:&mdash;“I hope it will not give as much work and
worry as my Chair here has given me.”</p>

<p>In the early part of 1913 <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie delivered in
Edinburgh the Munro lectures, which were published
the following year as <cite>The Antiquity of Man in
Europe</cite>, and of it his old friend <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Stevenson
says:&mdash;“This is no old man’s book.” In 1913, as
already stated, the book on <cite>Mountains</cite> was published,
and was dedicated to the author’s “Old Friends
and Colleagues on the Council of the Royal Scottish
Geographical Society.”</p>

<p>The summer of 1913 was spent in Skye, and
there <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie employed his leisure, as so often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
in holiday times, in writing verses. A few stanzas
may be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">Tired of <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Auld Reekie</span>’s stink and din,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">My thoughts fly far away,</div>
    <div class="p_line">And bear me on until I win</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">The shores of Broadford Bay.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">O there, I know, the heavens are bright,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Keen is the air and pure,</div>
    <div class="p_line">And calm the day, and still the night,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">And rest and sleep secure.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line"><span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Auld Reekie</span>, very dear art thou,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">And yet, tho’ fair to see,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Ten months within thy gates, I trow,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Are quite enough for me.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="p_line spread-out-short">. . . . .</p>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">Ended at last the weary round!</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Good-bye to leaden skies:</div>
    <div class="p_line">With every mile we onward bound</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Our spirits higher rise.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">Onward o’er <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">straths</span>, thro’ mountain glens,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Past shimmering <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">lochs</span> and streams,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Until we view, with all its Bens,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">The island of our dreams.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="p_line_i2">No care, no stress, no strain,</div>
    <div class="p_line">With heart revived and brain renewed,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Lost youth comes back again.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>But if, as these verses show, holiday times still as
of yore brought a sudden rebound of spirits, the
strain of life was obviously beginning to tell. A
pathetic letter has been preserved which was written
to an old student, now Dr M‘Alpine of the Depart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>ment
of Agriculture, Victoria, in the spring of 1914.
In it the writer says:&mdash;“Edinburgh has changed much
within the last thirty years. To me it is a very
different place, for I have seen so many of my old
friends and companions pass away. The ghosts of
those I have lost crowd about me, and like every old
chap I feel the pathos of life. But I cultivate the
philosophy of Daft Jamie Gordon, and believe it ‘<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">as
weel to dee goin’ as sittin’</span>.’ So I work away and
still find much to interest me in this workaday
world.”</p>

<p>In an accompanying letter Dr M‘Alpine recalls an
incident of his student days which made a great
impression upon him. One day, while with a party
who were being taken over Arthur’s Seat by <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Geikie, the discussion turned from the igneous rocks
of the hill to the evidences of former glaciation. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Geikie carefully removed the turf from some rocks near
the summit to show the finger-marks of the vanished
ice, and then as carefully replaced the grass in order
that the evidence of the past might be preserved.
For one of his students at least the unconscious act
read an unforgettable lesson of reverence.</p>

<p>This message from across the sea may serve to
suggest how much gain came from those years which
sometimes seemed to be spent largely in a weary
round of drudgery. It is not only in his books that
the dead man still speaks to the world. That, in
fair weather and in foul, in the prime of manhood and
when age was creeping on, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie led successive
bands of often raw youths and maidens over those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
hill-sides, has helped to give them an interest which
Nature alone could not give, a charm which untrodden
ways can never attain. On those grassy slopes an
old man saw visions and young men dreamed dreams,
and the dreams and the visions have become a part of
our island heritage.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1914 <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> and Mrs Geikie
went to stay at Appin. A friend of the family, a
keen entomologist, was to have been of the party,
but was at the last unable to come. From Appin
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie sent her a series of verses to console her
for the disappointment, which was not, he says, really
a disappointment, for a heavy storm had destroyed
all insect life in her customary collecting-grounds.
A few of the lines may be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza" lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">

 </div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p>To Appin also the family returned in summer,
after <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s retirement from the Chair at
Edinburgh, and it was there that they got the news
of the outbreak of war. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie gave his last
lecture at Edinburgh on 19th June, and his successor,
a former student of his own, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Jehu of St Andrews,
was appointed shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The rest of the story is soon told, for <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Geikie’s hope that his retiral from the professorship
would give him time for his own work was not
destined to be fulfilled. The autumn was spent&mdash;as
all spent that fateful autumn&mdash;in watching and
waiting, but unlike some of his fellow-countrymen,
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie, if he never doubted of the ultimate
result, was yet sure from the first that the war would
be long and terrible. He was not well throughout
the winter, for an attack of influenza in November
weakened him, and he seemed to have lost his power
of recovery. Later he suffered from his old enemy,
dyspepsia, though there did not appear to be any
particular cause for alarm. On the 1st of March he
died suddenly as the result of a heart attack, some
months before completing his seventy-sixth year.</p>

<p>He died as he would himself have wished to die,
without any slow progress of decay, and without
knowledge that the end was so near.</p>

<p>His contributions to science are discussed in the
<a href="#part-ii" title="Part 2">section</a> which follows: his personal character should
be apparent from what has been already said, without
the need of an elaborate analysis. As a friend wrote
to Mrs Geikie in the first days of her loss:&mdash;“There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
was always an out-of-door atmosphere about him, like
a strong wind sweeping over the moors bringing life
and health with it;” for the hills and open country
which he loved had taught him much.</p>

<p>In sum, he was through and through one of
the island folk, a true native of “this little island, this
England,” with its wide, wind-swept moorlands, its
disciplined freedom, its ordered life, and had in
addition the strong individuality of the northerner to
whom nothing comes without labour. Even the
<i>milieu</i> in which he was born is significant, for it
was that from which so many of the intellectuals
of Scotland have come; and it is noteworthy that
he remained a Scot to the end, at once fiercely critical
of his country and fellow-countrymen, and full of
intense love for the one and of profound sympathy
with the other. He never, like some anglicised
Scots, sold his birthright for a mess of pottage,
or faltered in the conviction that he was the heir
of a glorious heritage, won by the toil and sweat
of generations, and the result was to give something
of that poise and assuredness which those who are
false to their own traditions can never possess. It
will be clear also that there was nothing of the dry-as-dust
pedant about him, for he was above all things
a man, one for whom life in all its aspects was sweet.
He gave freely&mdash;to the world of his labours, to
his intimates of his affection, and he received much&mdash;honour
from his fellows, and what he perhaps prized
more, the love of those who knew the real man
beneath the northern shyness and reserve.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>

<p>All is transitory&mdash;his conclusions may be disputed,
new lights may be thrown on problems which seemed
to him conclusively solved; but the nation which
can produce such men can never be poor, and his
uprightness, steadfastness, and simplicity of character
enabled him to leave an abiding imprint upon his day
and generation.</p>

GEOLOGICAL WORK<br /><br />
CHAPTER X<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149" /><br />

<span class="sub_head smcap">The Glacial Problem before James Geikie</span></h2>

<p>In 1861, at the age of twenty-two, James Geikie,
as stated in <a href="#Page_19" title="Page 19">Chapter <abbr title="2">II.</abbr></a>, became an officer of the
Geological Survey and determined to devote his
life to scientific work.</p>

<p>For seventy years, ever since the time of the great
discussions about the theories of Hutton and Playfair
in the closing days of the eighteenth century, the
inhabitants of Edinburgh had been keenly alive to
the attractions of geological speculation. These older
controversies had died down, and the science was
gradually establishing itself on a broad basis of
recorded facts and observations. It was not yet
included among the subjects which had a place of
honour in the University curriculum, though the
professors of natural history since the time
of Jameson had delivered lectures on geology
(or geognosy as it was often called). <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Edward Forbes, who succeeded Jameson, and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Fleming (of the Theological College) were both
accomplished geologists. The Edinburgh Geological
Society had been established in 1834, and though
it did not as yet publish <cite>Transactions</cite>, it included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
many active geologists in the list of its members.
Geology, with its mixture of open-air activities, hard
facts of observation, and rich opportunities for speculative
controversy, has always possessed an attraction
for Scotsmen, and many of them have excelled in
it. In the Scottish capital in the early sixties the
burly figure of Hugh Miller was very well known.
His writings, with their curious mixture of geological
and theological matters, of fossil fishes and final
causes, were very widely read at that time, and the
sad tragedy of his death, the result of an overworked
brain, was fresh in the memory of all.</p>

<p>A man of very different qualities, but a brilliant
and thoroughly reliable geologist, who held a high
place in the intellectual life of Edinburgh, was
Charles Maclaren, one of the founders and for many
years the editor of the <cite>Scotsman</cite> newspaper. His
special field of work was the geology of the district
around the Firth of Forth, a region filled with the
most striking examples of geological structure and
the effects of geological processes. Maclaren was
constantly exploring the phenomena of this neighbourhood,
and the results of his observations appeared
regularly as articles in the <cite>Scotsman</cite>. No doubt this
kept the science prominently before the public; few
newspapers at the present time would venture to
print columns of exact and rather technical description
of the geological features of the district in which
they are published. Maclaren died in August 1866,
the year in which a second and much enlarged edition
of his volume on the <cite>Geology of Fife and the Lothians</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
was published. In the same year the <cite>Transactions
of the Edinburgh Geological Society</cite> began to appear,
but the Royal Physical Society, a successor of the
Wernerian Society, had for several years been issuing
<cite>Proceedings</cite>. Archibald Geikie had read a paper on
the Geology of Strath in Skye to the Edinburgh
Geological Society in 1853, and among the geologists
of note who attended the meetings were Rose,
Dr Page, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Foster Heddle, and Dr Hunter of
Carluke. Dr Page, afterwards Professor of Geology
at Newcastle-on-Tyne, was a well-known popular
lecturer on geology, and did a good deal to keep
alive an interest in the science.</p>

<p>In later years James Geikie often acknowledged
his indebtedness to <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> George Wilson, and the
stimulus he had received from him when a young
man bent on scientific studies. Wilson was Professor
of Technology in Edinburgh University, a subject
no longer included in the University curriculum.
It seems to have comprised parts of dynamics,
mechanical engineering and applied chemistry.
Wilson was a man of great personal charm, exceedingly
well informed, and always willing to help
young students along the path of learning. He
was interested in geology also, and undertook to
write the life of Edward Forbes, but finished only
the first six chapters, and the work was ultimately
completed by Archibald Geikie.</p>

<p>Although James Geikie was always a great
reader, it is not likely that he had more than an
elementary knowledge of geology when he joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the Survey in 1861. Trained geologists, however,
in those days were much less common than they are
now, and the Survey was prepared to enrol men who
had a good general education and showed special
inclination and aptitude for this line of work.
Careful personal selection must have been exercised,
for many of those who then joined its ranks rose
subsequently to high eminence in science. In field
geology no better training could have been given
than was adopted for these young men. They were
sent out day by day with surveyors who had
acquired a knowledge of field work, and were
inspected regularly by experienced geologists, who
corrected their errors and helped to solve their
difficulties. As already noted in Part <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> (see <a href="#Page_20" title="Page 20"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 20</a>),
his first work was the addition of drift lines to the
solid maps of parts of Fife and the Lothians, and
the drifts of the low grounds of Central Scotland
remained to the close of his life the subject which
interested him above all others, and with which he
had the fullest acquaintance in the field.</p>

<p>When Geikie began to map both the solid and
drift geology of a hitherto unsurveyed district, he
was sent to Ayrshire and West Lanarkshire, where
he undertook the survey of a large area stretching
from Eaglesham southwards to New Cumnock.
His brother was mapping, or had already mapped,
a broad strip extending inwards from the coast-line
and reaching from near Largs in the north to Dailly
in the south, while to the east of him was Peach
engaged in the survey of Southern Lanarkshire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
In those days a fairly large area (several hundred
square miles) was assigned to each geologist. The
whole district had to be very carefully examined and
the results recorded on topographical maps on the
scale of six inches to a mile. Each geologist was
expected to make a complete examination of his
ground and to note all the particulars regarding it.
Petrology was as yet in its infancy, and no very
minute classification of volcanic rocks was to be
expected; but the glacial geology and economic
geology were to be carefully investigated and fossil
localities noted, though, for the purpose of collecting
fossils, the assistance of special officers was provided.
The determination of all fossils requiring critical
skill was in the hands of the Survey palæontologists.
Each geologist surveyed from a hundred to a hundred
and fifty miles in a field season, which, allowing for
holidays, amounted to seven or eight months, and
to do this required regular hard work, much strenuous
walking, and the power of concentrating on the
general features, and not allowing one’s attention
to be absorbed by inconsequent details.</p>

<p>James Geikie seems to have had no difficulty
whatever in picking up the essentials of field
geology. He was very diligent and had sufficient
physical strength for his work. In time he became
a great walker, thinking nothing of covering fifty
miles in a day. The open-air life suited him
perfectly. He had one of the gifts most valuable
to a field-geologist, sometimes described as “an
eye for the country,” the faculty of interpreting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the geological meanings that underlie surface
features. Although never a professed palæontologist
he had a working knowledge of Carboniferous fossils,
and he was always a keen and critical observer of
rocks both in a fresh and in a weathered condition.
His early maps, judged even by the standards of
the present day, were astonishingly good, and always
give the impression that he went thoroughly into
the evidence so far as it was available. He was
cautious and thorough, and as a result of this
his maps show very few deletions due to changes
of opinion as fuller information was acquired during
the progress of his work. From the first he
exhibited great ability as a draughtsman, and his
maps and sections are not only very clear, well-proportioned,
and pleasing to the eye, but show also
an individuality which arose from natural gifts, and
was not acquired by copying models.</p>

<p>Although at that time geologists on the Survey
were not moved about the country so frequently as is
now the case, but settled down for several seasons
in a well-defined area, James Geikie had no reason
to complain of a lack of variety in the ground allotted
to him. His early stations in Fife and Kinross
included stratified and igneous rocks of Old Red Sandstone
and of Carboniferous Age, and in Peeblesshire
he made acquaintance with Silurian rocks, which at
that time were still very imperfectly understood, and
presented many difficult problems then unsolved.
It was in Ayrshire, however, that his powers most
fully displayed themselves, and the long period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
field work in that county from 1865 to 1872 undoubtedly
saw the development of his abilities as
a field-geologist. In after years many of the best
illustrations both of structural geology and of glacial
geology that enlivened his books and his lectures
were culled from the note-books in which he constantly
recorded the results of his observations in that field.
From his letters it seems that he disliked the coalfield
geology, which necessitated the examination of
mining plans, frequent attendance at colliery engineers’
offices, and great absorption in details which are of
little general importance. But no one would have
suspected this from his field maps, which, if we
remember how rapidly his work was done, show
much detail of underground structures taken from
colliery plans.</p>

<p>In Ayrshire he had for colleagues Sir Archibald
Geikie and Dr Peach; one of these was ultimately
to select volcanic geology as his province, while the
other attained great eminence as a palæontologist.
Already James Geikie was absorbed in glacial
geology; and each of the trio of geologists, though
doing ostensibly the same work, had already chosen
the special line of investigation in which he was
ultimately to become a master. He had a great
affection, too, for the warm-hearted, hospitable people
of the west of Scotland, and in “<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">braid Scots</span>” used to
relate many humorous episodes in which the sturdy
farmers and “<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">sma’ lairds</span>” displayed their <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">pawky</span>
humour. No full or adequate account of the work he
did in Ayrshire in these years has ever been published.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
The short descriptions of sheets 22, 23, and 19,
published by the Geological Survey, were in large part
written by James Geikie, but, owing to the necessities
of official publication entailing great brevity, they
contain merely an outline of his main conclusions.
The geologists who revised that ground forty years
after the original survey are unanimous in regretting
that more adequate description of the evidence which
James Geikie had collected was not placed before the
public.</p>

<p>After leaving Ayrshire he was transferred to
Kelso, and subsequently to the district ranging from
Perth to Dunkeld. From a geological point of
view this ground was considerably less varied; but
as his note-books show, he was by this time deeply
absorbed in glacial and Pleistocene geology, and every
scrap of information regarding the latest stages in
the physical history of Scotland was most carefully
recorded and its importance weighed. Many of the
conclusions he had already arrived at in Ayrshire
were confirmed by fresh evidence in these years.
And the estuary of the Tay, with its rich succession
of late-glacial and post-glacial accumulations, became
of great importance in his interpretation of the
“glacial succession,” a subject to which the remainder
of his life was devoted more than to any
other.</p>

<p>The circumstances that determined his bent
towards the investigation of glacial geology cannot
perhaps be fully elucidated now in the absence of any
statement from his own pen, but it is not difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
find many reasons that may have influenced him.
In considering this subject we may glance briefly at
the state of knowledge of this department of geology
at the time when he began field work. The years
1861 to 1865 saw a very remarkable development of
interest in glacial geology, occasioned by a sudden
appreciation of the importance of many facts previously
well known but imperfectly understood. Many active
geologists in Scotland were coming for the first time
to adopt the views which have ultimately obtained
acceptance in regard to the Pleistocene history of
Scotland, and the change of opinion which was going
on was somewhat similar to the still greater change
which took place when evolution first began to take
the form of a working hypothesis or even an established
law of Nature, and to sweep away a great
many honoured and treasured theories that had long
held sway over the minds of men.</p>

<p>The superficial deposits of sand, clay, and stones
that cover the solid rocks in the lower grounds of
Scotland, often to a depth of many feet, were considered
by most geologists as being of somewhat
mysterious origin. It was well known that they
contained boulders transported from a distance.
Around Edinburgh and Glasgow, for example, large
blocks of rock which must have been carried from the
Southern Highlands, fifty miles or more, were familiar
to those interested in geology. That the surfaces
of the rocks on which the drift or boulder-clay rested
were striated, grooved, and fluted, was also a well-known
fact. Early in the nineteenth century a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
favourite explanation of these deposits, which had
been supported by the celebrated Dean Buckland,
was that they were the remains of the Deluge as
described in Genesis. This theory, however, was
soon discarded though the name “Diluvial,” still
used by some writers to designate these strata, bears
witness to the former acceptance of that hypothesis.
For a long time they continued to be considered
as flood deposits, laid down by “debacles” of obscure
origin. No rational explanation for these powerful
“waves of translation” could be formulated, and
they failed completely to account for the remarkable
scratched surfaces on which the boulder-clay rested.
As the study of glaciers advanced, it became clear
that moving ice, bearing debris with it, could produce
striations exactly like those in question, and the
boulder-clay gradually came to be considered a glacial
deposit. Very important confirmation of this hypothesis
came from the observations of Mr Smith of
Jordanhill on the recent shelly clays of the west
of Scotland. Many of the mollusca which these
clays contained proved to be of species now living
in Arctic seas, and the inference was obvious that
at no very distant epoch a glacial climate had
prevailed in Scotland. About the year 1837 Agassiz
had been led by his investigation of the boulder-clay
of Switzerland to the conclusion that at one time the
glaciers had extended far beyond their present limits,
and had covered the plains at the foot of the Alps
with a vast confluent sheet of ice. Agassiz, in 1840,
visited Scotland with Dean Buckland, and as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
result of his observations had not hesitated to declare
that Scotland also had been swathed in an ice-sheet.
British geologists, however, were slow to accept
his conclusions, and the favourite explanation of the
“drifts” was that they had been laid down at the
bottom of a sea in which icebergs floated, transporting
great rock boulders from one place to
another.</p>

<p>In 1866 the veteran geologist Charles Maclaren,
then at the age of eighty-four, published the second
edition of his <cite>Geology of Fife and the Lothians</cite>,
and in his account of the “alluvial phenomena”
of the district he shows the transitional state in which
opinion then was passing from the iceberg hypothesis
to the land-ice hypothesis. “The dressed surfaces
as well as the ‘Till’ or Diluvium [the lower boulder-clay]
seem to have been mainly due to a great
envelope of ice acting for ages; the newer alluvium,
on the other hand [the upper boulder-clay], appears to
have been chiefly due to icebergs and ocean currents.
In thus attributing so much to the action of ice during
a long glacial period, it must ever be borne in mind
that oceanic currents preceded this ice action, and
that similar currents must have been in existence to
transport the icebergs to which we ascribe the erratic
blocks and boulders. Alternate submergence and
elevation of the north of Europe, combined with ice
on land and ice on water (in my opinion), must
satisfactorily explain these diluvial phenomena, which,
as unsettled problems, are still engaging the attention
of younger geologists.”</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
<p>One of the ablest champions of the land-ice
hypothesis was Robert Chambers, who was widely
known as a historian and a member of the famous
Edinburgh publishing firm. As early as 1852 he
ranged himself on the side of Agassiz, declaring
that floating icebergs and currents of water could not
possibly be accepted as a satisfactory explanation
of the boulder-clay and striated rock-surfaces. Mr
T. F. Jamieson of Ellon was making a very careful
study of the drifts of Aberdeenshire and the adjacent
counties, and had little hesitation in accepting the
theory of an extensive ice-sheet, covering these
districts and filling up all the valleys, as the explanation
most in accordance with the facts which he
had observed. He admitted, however, that subsequently
there had been a great submergence during
which many of the uppermost drift deposits had been
laid down.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Lyell, whose authority on questions
of theoretical geology at that time was paramount,
was also willing to accept the former existence of
glaciers over very extensive regions of the British
Isles, and described moraines that occur in the upland
valleys of Forfarshire, though he considered the drifts
of the lower grounds as mainly at any rate deposited
in cold seas in which icebergs floated. Much more
important than Lyell, or at least much more likely to
exert influence on the mind of James Geikie at an
early stage in his career, was Sir Andrew Ramsay,
then local Director of the Geological Survey. Ramsay
was a man after James Geikie’s own heart, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
can be no doubt that his influence on Geikie was very
great. We should not be far wrong, in fact, in regarding
Geikie as the direct successor of Ramsay in the line
of scientific thought. Through his whole life James
Geikie hardly departed from the position taken up by
Ramsay on glacial geology, though of course he
developed many new and important fields of investigation.
There was a remarkable similarity in their
outlook; they both relied on very much the same
class of evidence, depending specially on field geology
as a basis, but prepared to build up far-reaching
deductions from the facts they had observed. Most
of the theories enunciated by Ramsay were strongly
and consistently maintained by James Geikie up to the
close of his career. Ramsay also was more than
a glacialist. He left a deep mark in the study of
physiography, the origin and history of British
scenery, and in structural geology; and in these
subjects also James Geikie found continual inspiration.</p>

<p>When Geikie joined the Survey, Ramsay was at
the zenith of his powers. He had been for twenty
years an active field-geologist on the Survey staff;
had travelled very extensively over Great Britain on
geological work; was a well-known man in London
scientific circles; and from his official position had
unrivalled opportunities of making himself acquainted
with the field evidence bearing on all geological
questions then under review. He was endowed with
great energy and a warm imagination; a genial and
hearty comrade, very fond of a joke; well read in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
poetical and romantic literature; but withal a hard,
untiring worker who never spared himself or any
member of his staff where duty was concerned. The
two men were in many ways alike, and no doubt they
were very soon on terms of close friendship; and to
the latest days of his life James Geikie spoke of
Ramsay with deep affection and respect.</p>

<p>To the influence of Ramsay we must add that of
his brother. Archibald Geikie was already widely
known for his geological work, and second only to
Ramsay as an authority on theoretical questions
affecting British geology. He had been appointed to
the staff of the Geological Survey in 1855, six years
before James Geikie, and had rapidly risen into
prominence. Although at first he had given his
adhesion to the iceberg theory, his views had changed
under the influence of Ramsay, and in a classic paper
which he read to the Geological Society of Glasgow
in 1862 he had described the glacial deposits of
Scotland in an exhaustive manner. This paper, so
full in its details and so lucid and moderate in statement,
produced a great impression, at any rate in
Scotland, and clearly marked out the way along
which future progress was to be made. Though Sir
Archibald Geikie subsequently made few contributions
to glacial geology, deserting this field for the study
of volcanoes, and of other parts of physical and
historical geology, he did a very great service to
science in so clearly defining his position on a much
debated subject by publishing this paper.</p>

<p>As time went on, some of the younger geologists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
who had joined the Survey after James Geikie
became enthusiastic workers at glacial science, and
came to earn a reputation only second to Geikie
himself in this department of geology. Of these, we
may specially mention Dr John Horne and Dr
Benjamin N. Peach, both of whom became eminent
authorities on the glacial geology of Scotland. In
early years they were James Geikie’s most intimate
friends; their observations were always at his service,
and their criticism and advice he greatly valued.</p>

<h2 class="chapter" title="Chapter 11. “The Great Ice Age” and “Prehistoric Europe”">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="sub_head smcap">“The Great Ice Age” and “Prehistoric
Europe”</span></h2>

<p>The first edition of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite> was completed
in manuscript in 1873, and in the previous year
James Geikie had already published a series of papers
in the <cite>Geological Magazine</cite> which clearly outlined his
main conclusions. All the essential features which
were to distinguish his life-work in this highly controversial
field are already recognisable in these
papers. The principal characteristic of <cite>The Great
Ice Age</cite> is its literary ability, the power of lucidly
expounding intricate scientific theories and sketching
the evidence on which they rest in a manner which
equally avoids prolixity and obscurity. Although, as
we have shown, he was by no means the first to
champion the cause of land ice as against floating ice
as the dominant factor in the production of the drift,
he was immediately accorded the place of protagonist
in this cause. In Scotland his views, at any rate
among his colleagues on the Survey, were those
generally accepted. In England also the Survey
geologists were in agreement with him on most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
essential points, though the submergence hypothesis
and the efficiency of floating icebergs were long held
in esteem in the sister kingdom, and have not yet
completely fallen into disrepute. In Germany,
Norway, Sweden, Holland, and in North America
there had as yet been no general enlightenment on
the real merits of this controversy. It may be noted
that in the first edition of his <cite>Great Ice Age</cite>, James
Geikie did not deny the fact that a great submergence
accompanied the main glaciation of Britain. He
accepted it indeed, though in later years he saw
reason to modify this opinion.</p>

<p>The efficiency of land ice to explain most of the
puzzling features of the drifts was the main thesis
which the book was written to uphold. But there
were many subordinate problems which came up for
consideration. One of these is the amount of erosion
which the ice-sheets and glaciers had produced. In
this James Geikie followed very closely in the footsteps
of Ramsay; on the origin of rock-basins, fjords,
and sea lochs there is in fact practically complete
agreement in their views. This is the more significant,
because Ramsay was at that time far ahead of
educated geological opinion on these matters, and it
is only quite recently that his views have received
acceptance in some of the most influential geological
circles.</p>

<p>Another burning question which fell to be
considered was the evidence for or against interglacial
warm periods; a question which even at the present
time is almost as keenly debated as it was in 1874<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
when <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite> was published. As years
went past and successive editions of the book appeared,
the battle of land ice <i>versus</i> floating ice may be said
to have been definitely closed; and James Geikie’s
name as an expounder of glacial geology came to
be more and more closely associated with his views
on the glacial succession (the question, that is,
whether there was only one epoch of glaciation, or
several epochs separated by periods in which the
climate was much milder). On this subject, as on
glacial erosion, James Geikie took up his position very
strongly from the first and maintained it to the end.</p>

<p>In considering this branch of James Geikie’s
scientific work we may trace a considerable amount of
influence exerted on his thought by James Croll, one
of the most remarkable geologists that Scotland has
produced. Croll was a man who started life in a very
humble position; he educated himself, and by sheer
power of intellect and dogged perseverance he attained
eminence in scientific work. He was at once a
metaphysician and a physicist, but it is only with
the latter aspect of his teaching that we are here
concerned. Though quite unschooled in mathematics
he was daunted by no difficulties, and by laborious
calculation he worked out intricate problems of
astronomy; and the accuracy of his solutions was
afterwards confirmed by professional mathematicians
and astronomers. Croll saw at a very early stage
that to land ice must be ascribed practically the
whole of the glacial phenomena of Scotland. He
inferred from a number of facts that the North Sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
had been filled with Scandinavian ice during the
maximum stages of glaciation, and he suggested lines
of research to James Geikie, John Horne, and
Benjamin Peach that led to important contributions
to the literature of Scottish glacial geology. Croll
pondered long and deeply over the causes of the
Ice Age and the origin of changes of climate in
general, and the result was a series of papers in which
he maintained that changes in the eccentricity of the
earth’s orbit and the obliquity of the ecliptic, accompanied
by other astronomical processes, might produce
epochs of cold climate in one hemisphere with
warmer conditions in the opposite hemisphere. These
changes might under certain conditions be sufficient
to account for the existence of ice-sheets. During
the later years of his life Croll was a member of the
staff of the Geological Survey of Scotland, and this
silent, reserved, studious man was widely recognised
as a most original thinker.</p>

<p>James Geikie was much attached to Croll, and
while he never professed to be versed in the mathematical
branches of science, he was prepared to accept
the accuracy of Croll’s theories. The other causes of
glaciation which had been advanced by various
geologists, such as Lyell’s hypothesis of elevation and
depression of the land, he believed to be quite
inadequate, and in the first edition of <cite>The Great
Ice Age</cite> he states Croll’s hypothesis with evident
approval, or at any rate regards it as the only
explanation at that time offered which could be held
to be at all in accordance with the facts.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
<p>From this position Geikie never receded. In
subsequent years Croll’s hypothesis was the subject
of strenuous discussion. Eminent astronomers like
Sir Robert Ball found in it a satisfactory explanation
of Pleistocene glaciation. Equally eminent astronomers
like Simon Newcomb after testing it found it
wanting. The subject as a whole was beyond the
scope of Geikie’s work, which was geological rather
than astronomical or meteorological; and in his later
years he rather avoided the discussion of the causes
of glaciation, but he made it clear that in his opinion,
if Croll’s hypothesis failed, no other explanation could
be regarded as adequate.</p>

<p>As a corollary of Croll’s theory, it followed that
there had been more than one period of arctic cold
in the northern hemisphere, and that intercalated
between the cold periods there were epochs of warmer
climate&mdash;interglacial periods, as they are now called.
The evidence for the existence of interglacial periods
had appealed to Geikie in his field work, and he had
become convinced that in Scotland there had been at
least one interval of mild climatic conditions separating
two epochs of glacial severity. This may have to
some extent predisposed him to favour Croll’s
hypothesis as being in greatest accordance with the
geological facts. For it cannot be said that James
Geikie was in a hurry to maintain the complexity of
the Ice Age. In the first edition of his book, though
much engrossed in the description of the beds intercalated
with the boulder-clay and “till,” and obviously
inclined to attribute great importance to them, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
says very little about warm interglacial periods, and
the reader is not led to suppose that he considers
the evidence as of overwhelming strength. Three
years later the second edition of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>
appeared, and we find that the author then took
up a much more definite position on this subject, and
has made a great advance in his treatment of it.
But already in 1873 he was convinced in his own
mind that several warm interglacial periods had
interrupted the rigours of the Ice Age, though he did
not attempt to enumerate the interglacial epochs in
detail, or to state fully the conclusions at which he
had arrived.</p>

<p>The post-glacial history of Scotland was a subject
that early attracted James Geikie’s attention. He
had devoted much study to it, and was in after years
to present a masterly analysis of its stages and
sequence. To trace the connection between the Ice
Age and the present day, and to show the changes
which had elapsed since the ice-sheets melted from
the surface of Britain, was to him one of the most
alluring departments of geology. A good deal of
work had been done by Scottish geologists on the
study of the raised beaches of Scotland, but no
general account of their relation to one another and
to the glacial boulder-clay and moraines had appeared
before the publication of the first edition of <cite>The Great
Ice Age</cite>. That the sea-level had undergone alterations
around our shores was sufficiently demonstrated by
the raised beaches, of which three were very well
known, the 100-foot, 50-foot, and 25-foot beaches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
But some authors, such as Chambers and Mackintosh,
were ready to find raised beaches anywhere; gravel
terraces at all elevations, many of which are now
known to have been the deposits of glacial rivers and
lakes, and rock escarpments and platforms of very
varied origin, were appealed to as evidence of former
submergence beneath the sea. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie at this
stage was not altogether free from a belief in the
great submergence, or at any rate he was not prepared
to challenge its champions; but he knew how little
value was to be attached to some of the evidence
cited in its support, and his own studies had led him
to a fuller understanding and a more satisfactory
appreciation of the meaning of the raised beaches and
the light they threw on the varied conditions that
had prevailed in Scotland during and subsequent to
the melting of the great ice-sheet. In particular, he
maintained that the higher beaches were associated
with the deposits of clay containing glacial shells that
were so well known through the researches of Smith
of Jordanhill, and belonged to a time when glacial
conditions had not completely ceased in Scotland.
The 50-foot beach was associated with the oldest
relics of man in the midland valley of Scotland, while
the 25-foot beach and lower beaches were laid down
in climatic surroundings differing little from those of
the present day. Between the epochs of depression
which these sea-terraces recorded there had been
intervals when the land stood at a higher level, so
that the earth movements had been of an oscillating
character, and not merely a succession of uplifts with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
intervening pauses during which the beach-platforms
were produced. The buried forests and the peat-bogs
furnished additional evidence of the elevation
and depression of the land, and hinted, not obscurely,
at the probability that changes of climate had also
taken place during post-glacial time, the warm
continental epochs encouraging the growth of trees,
while the cold, damp, insular climates were favourable
to the accumulation of peat. Although these conclusions
were only sketched out and not fully stated,
it is plain to the reader that already <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie had
convinced himself of the importance of these facts.</p>

<p>And in considering what is probably the most
controversial problem which the student of Pleistocene
and recent times must investigate, namely, the relation
of prehistoric man to the glacial period, he followed
the same line of thought, considering that the
evidence of the mammalian remains found in caves
and river gravels of Northern Europe pointed to the
conclusion that there had been great variations of
climate. The mixture of northern and southern types
of animals was not to be ascribed in his opinion to
migrations arising from seasonal changes, but was
due principally to alternations of cold and heat, each
enduring for a considerable time. He advocated also
the existence of man in glacial times, and recapitulating
views already enumerated in some papers which
he had published in the <cite>Geological Magazine</cite>, he
argued that the palæolithic gravels of England were
to be regarded as glacial and preglacial, and not, as was
widely believed, of interglacial and post-glacial age.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
<p>Lastly, we may mention a feature of the first
edition of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite> that was to become more
prominent in subsequent editions, the comparative
description of the phenomena described by geologists
of many different countries. For information regarding
England he was largely indebted to his colleagues
in the English Survey, principally Green, Tiddeman,
and Whitaker. The Swedish, German, Norwegian,
and continental deposits generally had perforce to
be described from the literature of the subject, a
literature already very extensive. Through his whole
life <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie was a diligent student of the literature
of his subject. The most important European
languages, as already noted in <a href="#part-i" title="Part 1">Part <abbr title="1">I.</abbr></a>, he could read
with facility, and as he was in constant receipt of
copies of glacial papers from their authors, much of
his time was taken up with a study of the contemporary
literature of glaciation. It was his familiarity
with the work of other investigators in this field of
scientific research that gave him his position as the
representative British glacialist, and made his works
so widely read and appreciated by foreign scientific
men.</p>

<p>With the publication of the first edition of <cite>The
Great Ice Age</cite> in 1874, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s reputation as
a glacial geologist of the first rank was at once
established. The book had a cordial reception and
a ready sale. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Green wrote a long and very
sympathetic review of it for <cite>Nature</cite>, and, whether
its teachings were generally accepted or not, the
author had the satisfactory proof that it had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
been neglected by the rapid exhaustion of the first
edition. Within a few months he had to set seriously
about the production of a new and enlarged edition.
Much of its popularity was no doubt due to the
clear and graceful style in which it was written.
The more abstruse parts of the subject were not
discussed with too much detail; great insistence
was placed on the field evidence, and the discussion
was such as could be followed by the general reader
who had no special training in geological work.
A studied moderation marked the conclusions
arrived at, and no attempt was made to force a
revolutionary interpretation of glacial phenomena
into prominence. A great deal also was due to
the fact that the book embodied not only its author’s
work and the hypotheses he favoured, but also the
results of the observations of many of his colleagues
on the Survey who had a very wide acquaintance
with field geology, and were, on the whole, very
well agreed regarding the interpretation of the facts.
The author fully acknowledged his obligations to
colleagues on the Survey staff, but at the same
time it was clear that on this subject he was the
leader and not merely a compiler of other people’s
results. The dedication to Sir Andrew Ramsay
is especially significant, for from Ramsay more
than from any other geologist had inspiration
been received.</p>

<p>Probably the effect of the book was greater in
foreign countries than in Britain. In Germany,
Switzerland, Sweden, and the United States many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
geologists were actively prosecuting the study of
glacial deposits, and so clear and authoritative a
statement of the observations and conclusions of
the Scottish glacialists had much interest to workers
in other lands. This appreciation the author valued
greatly, and it was the cause of a great enlargement
in the circle of his correspondents. He followed
keenly the advance of glacial investigation in foreign
countries, and especially the new evidence brought
forward regarding changes of climate during and
subsequent to the glacial period, and the early
chapters in the history of man in Europe.</p>

<p>The second edition, which appeared three years
after the first, showed that the author had
been led to modify his views in several important
respects. The great post-glacial submergence he
now considered unproved, following in this the
conclusions arrived at by Dr Jamieson of Ellon in
his studies of the Scottish glacial deposits. He
recognised also that the shelly boulder-clay of many
parts of Scotland, such as Caithness, Orkney,
Shetland, Dumbartonshire, and Ayrshire, was best
explained on the lines suggested by Dr James Croll
as the deposit of an ice-sheet that had invaded the
land after travelling for a time over the sea bottom.
In this we see the influence of Dr Peach and
Dr Horne’s work on the glaciation of Caithness,
Shetland and Orkney, and of Geikie’s own investigation
of the glacial phenomena of the Outer Hebrides.
These changes of opinion were undoubtedly well
considered, and have been supported by subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
discoveries. He also took up a much bolder attitude
on the question of interglacial deposits and the
relation of man to the Ice Age. While still relying
to the full on the evidence cited from Scotland in
the first edition of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite> in favour of
the existence of more than one interglacial period,
he adduced the results of Skertchly’s work at
Brandon as proving that the palæolithic deposits
of south-eastern England are in places overlain by
genuine boulder-clay. More prominence was also
given to the continental evidence for interglacial
periods, especially to that obtained in the Dürnten
lignite of the north side of the Alps, and of the
so-called Pliocene beds of Lombardy, which even
in the first edition he had confidently claimed as
being really interglacial.</p>

<p>The next important work from <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s
pen was <cite>Prehistoric Europe</cite>, published in 1881. He
continued to keep abreast of the rapidly increasing
literature of his subject, and although the main lines of
his treatment of it required little modification, he was
continually adding to his store of facts. <cite>Prehistoric
Europe</cite> did not receive the same welcome as <cite>The Great
Ice Age</cite>, and this could hardly be expected. Geologists
were by this time familiar with the author’s main
conclusions, and the book in some measure takes
us over familiar ground. But to the general reader
it remains one of the most enjoyable of the author’s
contributions to the literature of science.</p>

<p>Having already expounded in his previous works
the essential phenomena of glaciation, he devotes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
this book especially to the consideration of many
questions of subordinate importance, though in
themselves deserving of full consideration. The interglacial
problem, of course, comes up for treatment,
but he has not much to say of it that is really new
to his readers. It is interesting to note, however,
that less insistence is now laid on the Scottish
evidence in favour of interglacial periods, and the
British evidence in general, and more is said of
the interglacial beds of Germany, France, Italy,
Switzerland, and other European countries. The
feeling seems to have arisen in the author’s mind
that much of the British evidence was not so strong
as to carry conviction, and the work of continental
geologists was rapidly adding details of the highest
significance to the store of accumulated observations
in favour of repeated glaciations of Northern Europe.
We may readily believe also that he felt it desirable
to enforce on the minds of his readers the value
of much recent research done by his fellow-scientists
in other countries. Many British geologists assumed
and still maintain a very sceptical attitude regarding
the value of the British evidence for interglacial
periods, and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie was undoubtedly right
in appealing rather to well-established facts in
adjacent countries than attempting to discuss the
minutiæ of sections often of a temporary nature and
by no means well-exposed, which were familiar
to many of his British readers. It is not to be
supposed, however, that he had changed his ground;
to the last he maintained the validity of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
evidence for interglacial periods, though in some parts
of it modifications of his original statements might
have become necessary. In the nature of things the
evidence collected from so small an area as Scotland
was sure to be incomplete, and to treat Great Britain
as a region apart was more likely to lead to error than
to correct results.</p>

<p>Another subject which he handled more fully than
in <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite> was the antiquity of the human
relics of palæolithic type which had been found in
caves and river gravels. Many British geologists
of the highest reputation held that these were of
post-glacial date, but <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie had always contended
strongly that some at least of the deposits
containing the implements of early man were interglacial
or preglacial. Time has justified his sagacity,
and it is now fairly widely recognised that these relics
date back in some cases to periods anterior at any
rate to the last glaciation of Northern Europe. The
old controversy regarding changes of climate in
Pleistocene time reappears in this volume, and the
author stoutly maintains the position he had taken
up in <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>, that the association of the
remains of mammals of southern and northern types
in gravel deposits can be explained only on the
hypothesis that periods of genial alternated with
periods of arctic climate.</p>

<p>But perhaps the main purpose of this book, as
seems to be indicated by the title selected for it, was
to discuss the changes that had taken place in Europe
since the melting of the ice of the last stage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
glacial period. The phenomena of the raised beaches
that encircle our Scottish coasts, with the alluvial or
“carse” clays of the river valleys intimately associated
with the beach deposits, and the peat and buried
forests of our moorlands and coasts, had fascinated
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie since the beginning of his glacial
investigations, and he felt that for their proper
discussion more scope was required than was afforded
by such a book as <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>. These
problems were full of difficulties and the evidence
appeared often contradictory or misleading, but
he managed to piece it together and to arrive at
a consistent and clearly reasoned interpretation. The
raised beaches indicate, of course, changes of the level
of sea and land; but these were far more considerable
than the beaches alone would indicate, as the submerged
forests that in many places are intercalated
with the beach and carse deposits show that at certain
stages the land area had been far more extensive than
at present. This was confirmed by many facts
regarding the present distribution of animals and
plants in the British Isles which could not otherwise
be logically explained; and in this field of investigation
he gratefully acknowledges the assistance
furnished by his old friend Dr Buchanan White,
with whom he was in close contact since he was
then living in Perth. The raised beaches also were
associated with the closing phases of glaciation in
Britain, since both the 100-foot and the 50-foot beaches
in the north of Scotland showed effects of contemporaneous
glacial action, and the older marine shell beds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
contained shells now living only in Arctic seas. The
interpretation of the evidence to be obtained from the
study of peat-bogs and buried forests was by no
means so clear, but indubitably pointed towards the
recurrence of damp cold epochs suitable for the
rapid growth of peat, separated by epochs of
a different character during which the country was
overspread by a dense growth of forest. These
hypotheses had long occupied the author’s mind, and
he had pondered deeply over the evidence in support
of them. Fuller investigation in future years was
destined to bring out many striking confirmations
of his opinions. It may be said that so far as his
interpretation of the post-glacial history of Scotland
is concerned, the most authoritative opinion of Scottish
geologists at the present time is in accordance with
the conclusions which he had arrived at. This
alone makes the book still worth careful study by
those who would appreciate the changes our islands
have undergone in the most recent stages of their
geological history, and though notable additions have
been made to the store of accumulated observations,
they readily find a place in the scheme which he has
outlined.</p>

<h2 class="chapter" title="Chapter 12. Educational and Administrative Work">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="sub_head smcap">Educational and Administrative Work</span></h2>

<p>With his appointment in 1882 to the Murchison
Chair of Geology and Mineralogy in Edinburgh
University to succeed his brother Sir Archibald
Geikie, a new epoch began in James Geikie’s career.
For some years he had been District Surveyor
on the Scottish Survey, a post of considerable
responsibility, and requiring the exercise of tact
and firmness, but one which presented most valuable
opportunities to a keen geologist. The Scottish
Survey at that time had an exceptionally strong
personnel, and in pure field geology was setting
a standard of excellence which has rarely been
surpassed. Several of his colleagues came to be
recognised in the course of a few years as scientific
men of the highest distinction, and among them
there was a spirit of camaraderie and of friendly
emulation in research which made their daily tasks
a constant source of novelty and of unflagging
interest. To many of his colleagues, such as Peach,
Horne, Jack, Croll, Skae, and Irvine, James Geikie
had been indebted for important information and
for the most searching criticism, combined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
unselfish appreciation of the value of his work.
The ground surveyed had most of it been previously
examined only in a quite unexhaustive way, and
had consequently the attraction of novelty; it was
also of very varied structure, and, more important
from his point of view, it was rich in evidence of
glacial action. No better training ground for a
field-geologist who intended to devote himself to
the study of glaciation could well be imagined.</p>

<p>Among the Scottish geological staff James
Geikie’s position as a field-geologist and as a
glacialist was fully recognised, and he had the
unquestioning support of his colleagues. His life
was full of variety and interest. No doubt, like
other men, he had made mistakes and had been
severely handled by some of his critics. Some of
his early work on the Silurian volcanic rocks of
Ayrshire, for example, had suffered greatly from
his insufficient knowledge of the chemical and
mineralogical foundations on which geology rests.</p>

<p>Probably this criticism taught him to be more
careful in speculation and more critical in accepting
evidence. But his field work, as a whole, was of the
highest standard. His field maps of Carboniferous
and Devonian ground proved to be exceptionally
thorough and accurate. In these early years, of
course, it was not intended to execute a survey on a
very minute scale. The large area upon which each
surveyor was expected to report each year prevented
him from spending more than a limited time on
a small district. Moreover, the literature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
geology of Scotland was as yet by no means large.
Many of the more specialised branches of geology,
such as petrology, were as yet in a very rudimentary
state. Perhaps on that account the field-geologist
was expected to be more of an all-round geologist,
and to rely less on the guidance of specialists than
his successors at the present time.</p>

<p>The opportunities presented to him he had made
use of to the fullest. He was a born observer.
The retentiveness of his memory for localities and for
geological details was extraordinary; but that he did
not trust to it exclusively his well-filled note-books
bear witness. What distinguished him specially,
however, was his power of maintaining his interest
in the abstract questions of geology and the indomitable
perseverance and industry with which he
pursued his researches in spite of the distractions
of field work. Not many geologists after an arduous
day in the open air could sit down, as was his habit,
and spend many hours in literary work, or in the task
of mastering the papers, in many foreign languages,
in which the progress of glacial geology was recorded.
Even admitting that he was a ready writer, we must
acknowledge that his power of work at this time
was enormous, and we cannot wonder that at times
he felt on the verge of a breakdown.</p>

<p>The testimonials which he had printed when
making application for the Professorship of Geology
in Edinburgh show how thoroughly his reputation
as a scientist was established in Europe and America.
His book on <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite> receives high praise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
from Norwegian, Swedish, Swiss, German, Italian,
and American geologists, and among his British
supporters he could number Darwin, Evans, and
Hooker.</p>

<p>It was not, as already seen, without reluctance that
James Geikie decided to leave the Geological Survey.
The earnest scientific spirit in which its work was
conducted, the intimate fellowship with scientific men
of kindred spirit, and the free open-air life had great
attractions for him. The academic life was new to
him, and must have seemed at first a cabined and
cribbed existence compared with that of a field-geologist.
Yet there is no doubt the choice was a
wise one. In the higher departments of Survey
work his duties would have been mostly of an
administrative nature, and much of his time would
have been taken up by routine business, very largely
of a non-geological character, which would certainly
have proved uncongenial. His opportunities of visiting
the field would also have been much curtailed.
Residing in Edinburgh, he could keep in intimate
touch with his former colleagues of the Survey, and
glean the most valuable results of their work when
they returned to the office each year. They were
now beginning the survey of the North and West
Highlands, and were to undertake investigations of a
kind with which he was quite unacquainted. A good
deal of new information on glacial geology was being
collected by them year by year, and of course communicated
to him regularly. But the main work in
hand was the unravelling of the intricate history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the Highlands and the palæontology and petrology of
the older rocks of Scotland. This was destined to
yield most brilliant results, and the Scottish Survey
was to become more famous even than it had been
in the days of Sir Andrew Ramsay; but these fields
of investigation were not those which he had chosen
for his own especial study, and there can be no doubt
that as a university professor, with ample time for
research in any branch of his subject which appealed
to him, he was able to follow out his own line of work
far more untrammelled than he would have been as
an officer of the Geological Survey.</p>

<p>To the execution of the duties of his Chair he
devoted himself with characteristic thoroughness and
energy. His brother had combined the office of
Director of the Geological Survey of Scotland with
the Murchison Professorship, but James Geikie was
free to give his whole time to university work. At
first, at any rate, he had little spare time on his hands.
Well versed in Scottish geology and in the physical
and structural divisions of the science, he had also a
wide knowledge of stratigraphical geology and of the
geological structure of Europe and North America.
He worked hard to increase his knowledge of
mineralogy, petrology, and palæontology, even setting
up a laboratory to carry out mineral assays. Ever
a skilful draughtsman, he prepared with his own hand
many drawings of landscapes, geological sections,
and the microscopic structure of rocks. He was
always rather averse to the use of the lantern to
illustrate his lectures, and preferred large wall diagrams,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
many of which had cost great pains to make. From
every available source he collected specimens of rocks,
minerals, and fossils. He was unsparing in his efforts
to make his subject as interesting to his students as
possible, and to relieve them of the tedious work of
taking voluminous manuscript notes. For this
purpose he prepared long series of memoranda, and
had copies of them struck off by a primitive duplicating
apparatus.</p>

<p>As a lecturer he had rather an easy-going,
colloquial style, which undoubtedly had the merit of
catching and holding the attention of even the least
intellectual of his audience. He spoke fast, and
covered a very large part of his subject in the course
of the one hundred lectures which constituted the work
of the winter class, but by the help of the memoranda
above mentioned his students had little difficulty in
keeping abreast of his progress. Brimful of humour
and of fun, he was not above making an occasional
joke to his audience; but this aspect of his character
was far more in evidence on his Saturday excursions.
However long the walk and however unpropitious the
weather, there was always a circle of admiring students
around him, intent on catching every detail of the
amusing stories, reminiscences, and snatches of old
ballads or songs, of which he had an unfailing supply.
From the first he proved a very successful professor.
His course was at that time optional, in the sense
that candidates for the recognised degrees of the
University did not require to take it. Only students
desirous of studying geology for its own sake were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
to be found on the benches of his class-room. He
had always also a fair number of men who were not
regular students but engaged in professional work,
who desired to widen the range of their intellectual
vision, and took an occasional class at the University.
Many of these were teachers occupied all day in the
schools of the city; and to meet the needs of such
men he fixed his hour for lecturing at four o’clock in
the afternoon, so as to give them a chance of attending
after their day’s work. Many of these students
afterwards became his attached personal friends, and
in this group were included missionaries home on
leave, army men, journalists, doctors taking postgraduate
courses at the University, and planters and
mining engineers enjoying a long holiday at home
after years spent in foreign countries.</p>

<p>At first he conducted all the classes himself, but
after a time the University granted him an assistant,
and he started a regular practical or laboratory course.
His relations with his assistants were of the most
sympathetic character. Always ready to take more
than his fair share of the drudgery of elementary
teaching, he showed the most kindly interest in the
progress of his assistants, and encouraged them to
carry out original research on their own account.
His fine library and wide knowledge of the literature
of geology were always at their service, and as the
University in those days was by no means liberally
endowed with funds for the purchase of scientific
apparatus, he often provided at his own expense
the instruments necessary for special researches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
The rooms assigned to the geological department
were miserably inadequate&mdash;dark, half-furnished
attics, draughty, cold, and uncomfortable&mdash;but much
good work was done there.</p>

<p>James Geikie lived to see the conditions of
university teaching in Edinburgh greatly altered
for the better. The courses qualifying for degrees
were made much less restricted, and geology became
a subject in the curriculum for the Arts as well as the
Science degree. The number of students increased,
and the status of the Chair was improved. Better-paid
assistants were provided, increased grants for
the purchase of apparatus, and a higher stipend for
the professor. A very important addition to the
department was the provision of a library of geological
books, the gift of Sir Archibald Geikie and James
Geikie in the first place, subsequently taken over
and maintained by the University Library authorities.
The prestige of geology in the University and the
condition of the department in 1914 when he resigned
were incomparably superior to those which existed in
1882 when he was appointed to the Chair.</p>

<p>In 1894 he became Dean of the Faculty of
Science in the University, and continued to hold
this responsible appointment till a year before his
retiral. Although he did not by any means suffer
fools gladly, he had much sympathy with students
and with his colleagues, the professors, lecturers,
and assistants, in the difficulties which they encountered
in their work, and he had good business
faculties, being careful, prompt, and industrious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
The great esteem in which he was held by all who
came in contact with him was clearly proved by
his long tenure of this exacting post, and his success
in smoothing the difficulties inevitable in university
life where so many interests have to be considered.
The time required for this work he gave ungrudgingly;
but as he was at the same time Honorary Editor of
the Royal Scottish Geographical Society’s <cite>Magazine</cite>,
and eventually President of that Society, and served
on the Council of the Royal Society of Edinburgh
for many years, he felt that his time for research and
literary work was very seriously curtailed.</p>

<p>If we consult the list of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s contributions
to scientific literature which appears as an
<a href="#Page_213" title="Page_213">appendix</a> to this volume, it becomes evident that
with his appointment to the Edinburgh professorship
he began to write on several topics which previously
had not specially engaged his attention. The
voluminous notes from which his lectures were
delivered were abridged, rearranged, and ultimately
published as his <cite>Outlines of Geology</cite>. This work
was expressly meant for the use of his own students,
and served to relieve them of a large part of the
tedious note-taking which was in those days a heavy
burden on members of the University classes. It
found acceptance, however, in a wider circle, and in
time three large editions of the book were sold.
Its most distinctive feature is the ample space devoted
to physical geology, especially the processes at work
to-day which throw light on the structures and origin
of rocks. The more technical portions of the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
such as petrology and palæontology, he considers
in much less detail. In fact, the book is quite as
suitable for the general reader as for the university
student. This book appeared in 1888, and seventeen
years later his second and most successful text-book
was published, the <cite>Structural and Field Geology
for Students</cite>. His natural abilities as an observer,
and his thorough training as a field-geologist, made
him especially competent to handle this subject
effectively, and he made judicious use of photographs
taken by the Geological Survey to illustrate the
volume. The success of the book was also in large
measure due to his long experience as a teacher and
his clear and easy style; in fact, the foundations of
the text-book were laid in the courses of lectures
on structural geology which he used to deliver in
the summer sessions. Something also, no doubt,
was due to there being no really good work on this
subject for English and American students. He
was much gratified by its success, for he felt that
he had done something to stimulate accurate field
surveying by students of geology, and field work
he always considered the most educative part of
geological training.</p>

<p>Here we may mention also his contributions to
<cite>Chambers’s Encyclopædia</cite>, for which he wrote many
of the geological articles. In 1875 he had prepared
a small Elementary Manual for the well-known Edinburgh
firm of publishers, and as successive editions
of the <cite>Encyclopædia</cite> were printed he continued to
revise his geological articles, so that he had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
continuous connection with Messrs Chambers lasting
over forty years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His work as a geographer next claims our
attention. The fields of geological research which
he especially cultivated have a very close connection
with geographical science. In the Scottish Geographical
Society, as already stated, he took a deep
interest from the start. For many years his face was
a familiar one on the platform at the lectures delivered
by eminent geographers and distinguished travellers
in Edinburgh, and as these lectures are always very
well attended, probably his connection with the
Society made him better known to the general public
than any other of his numerous activities. These
functions also brought him into contact with many
explorers and scientists who came to Edinburgh to
lecture, and were the source of many friendships which
he valued highly. During the latter years of his life
the Geographical Society claimed almost as much
of his attention as his academic duties, and as he was
fortunately assisted by very competent lecturers in
the University, he could spare the time required to
fulfil both functions.</p>

<p>His studies in geography were always in those
fields which form the border-land between geology
and geography. The history of the development of
scenery and of earth-forms in general, and the relation
between geological structure and geographical configuration,
were favourite subjects for his pen. In
this he was a true follower of Playfair. He delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
also to prepare short notices for the Society’s
magazine, describing the results of recent work on
prehistoric man, on changes of climate in recent
geological periods, and the action of ice in the
production of surface features. The magazine proved
a useful vehicle for conveying to the public the results
of his wide reading on topics such as these. Many of
the articles which first appeared in its pages were
subsequently issued in book form, or were used in the
preparation of the third edition of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>,
and the other scientific treatises which he produced.</p>

<p>In 1893 he collected the most important and
interesting of his scientific lectures and addresses
into a volume to which he gave the title <cite>Fragments of
Earth Lore</cite>. The book was published by his friend
Dr Bartholomew of the Edinburgh Geographical
Institute, and served to introduce the results of some
of his researches to a wider circle of readers than they
would otherwise have reached, as they had originally
appeared in publications as widely different in purpose
as <cite>Good Words</cite> and the <cite>Transactions of the Geological
Society of Edinburgh</cite>. Most of the papers, as was to
be expected, treat of the progress of glacial geology,
and one of these is of special importance. It is
entitled “The Glacial Succession in Europe,” and
was reprinted from the <cite>Transactions of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh</cite>. It shows considerable progress
along the lines which his work on glacial and interglacial
periods had previously followed, and was the
precursor of the third edition of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>, in
which the new developments of this branch of science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
were to be more fully expounded. Among the other
papers are several which are excellent popular
scientific articles, such as the sketch of the “Geology
of the Cheviot Hills,” originally issued in <cite>Good Words</cite>
in 1876. These essays show him at his best as an
exponent of the simpler and more attractive themes
of geological literature. He had an easy, fluent style,
and had he chosen to do so, might have attained
great popularity as an exponent of science for the
million. The fine illustrations of this book deserve
special mention, especially the maps, which owe much
to the skill and artistic taste of Dr Bartholomew,
who in this matter had the cordial support and
co-operation of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie. Ever since his days
on the Geological Survey he had set a very high
standard in the preparation of maps, and paid the
greatest attention to their artistic qualities as well as
to their excellence as scientific documents.</p>

<p>His book on <cite>Earth Sculpture</cite> followed in 1898,
and in this particular field soon came to be recognised
as a standard work. It was published as one of a
series, and the limitations of space probably did not
allow very complete discussion of so large a subject:
in fact, it is only a sketch of the relations between
geology and surface features; but the subject was one
for which he had a great liking, and he dwelt on it
lovingly in the lectures which he delivered each winter
to the University students. In this, of course, he
followed the Scottish tradition, which since the days
of Hutton and Playfair had assigned to this branch
of geology a special importance. The writing of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
little book accordingly was a real pleasure to him, and
he drew nearly all the illustrations for it with his own
hand, feeling that the only difficulty was to keep
himself within the limits which necessity imposed.
His immense knowledge of geographical literature
supplied him with abundant material to illustrate the
operation of natural agents in giving rise to modifications
of topographical form, and the change of subject-matter
from the always more or less controversial
questions of the glacial history of the northern
hemisphere afforded stimulus to his pen.</p>

<h2 class="chapter" title="Chapter 13. Interglacial Controversies">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="sub_head smcap">Interglacial Controversies</span></h2>

<p>The second edition of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite> was sold
out about the year 1892, and the author set himself
to the task of preparing a third edition, incorporating
all the most recent investigations. The task was
necessarily a very severe one, as an enormous increase
had taken place in the number of workers in this field,
and the evidence had accumulated at a very rapid
rate. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie always regarded this work as his
principal contribution to geological literature, an
opinion which most of his critics seem to have shared;
and certainly the labour he spent on the third edition
of his <i>magnum opus</i> was sufficient to entitle it to a
high place in the history of glacial investigation.
With indomitable perseverance he undertook the
work of mastering the literature, and the number of
papers he read may be inferred from the fact that
his collection of pleistocene and glacial pamphlets,
which now form a part of the noble library of the
University of Edinburgh, numbered over one hundred
and sixty volumes. He aimed at making the book not
only a compendium of information on the subject of
which it treated, but also a critical review of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
conclusions which might fairly be drawn from the
evidence to hand; and in this he not unfrequently
differed from the authors of the papers he cited, a
proceeding which was likely to awaken feelings the
reverse of grateful.</p>

<p>The subject-matter was now, of course, so vastly
enlarged that only the more important contributions
could be adequately noticed, and much interesting
detail had to be passed over or handled only in the
briefest way. Many of the old controversies which
had bulked largely in the first and second editions of
the book had been decided, or had been so fully
discussed that there was no pressing need to devote
much space to them; but the subject as a whole was
not less involved in uncertainty and debate, for new
topics of discussion had arisen, hardly less keenly
disputed than the old ones. In the main lines of his
argument <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie still followed the teaching
of Ramsay and Croll and the geologists of the old
Scottish school, and though, for example, no longer
inculcating the necessity of a great glacial subsidence,
he maintained most of the positions he had taken up
in his early days. In one respect, however, the work
marked a great advance, for he now believed it
possible to subdivide the history of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>
into a succession of glacial and interglacial periods
with far more minute detail than he had hitherto
attempted. In this he showed a boldness which
some critics might call rash, but which has been in
very large measure justified by the results of subsequent
research. He came to be recognised as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
pre-eminently the defender of interglacial periods;
and to this aspect of the book far more attention has
been directed than to any other. James Geikie, in
fact, was soon considered an ultra-interglacialist, if we
may coin a ponderous but perhaps expressive term.
The technical details of the evidence cannot be
discussed in this place; it will be sufficient to say that
he believed there was good evidence in Scotland and
in Europe generally for the former existence of no
less than six glacial periods separated by intervals of
milder climate which were truly interglacial.</p>

<p>At the time the book was published it is no
exaggeration to say that he was alone in holding
these views. Glacial investigation had made considerable
progress in Scotland since 1877, when the
second edition of his book was issued; but most
Scottish geologists, though in agreement with <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Geikie on many points, would hardly have followed
him in the extreme position which he took up.
That interglacial periods had existed they generally
admitted, but the searching criticism to which the
evidence in favour of them had been subjected had
revealed that much of it was of an indecisive character,
if not actually untrustworthy; and no British geologists
of that time had <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s wide knowledge of
the glacial literature of other countries. They were
consequently often unable to appreciate how far the
continental evidence filled up the gaps which were
painfully evident in the record of British glacial
history. In certain circles, in England especially, the
evidence for interglacial periods was regarded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
sceptical distrust, if not completely disbelieved; but
on Clement Reid, his former colleague on the Survey,
and one of the most skilled and critical glacialists
then living, it had produced a different impression.
He saw clearly the necessity for admitting the
existence of at least one interglacial period; but
between his position and that of James Geikie, who
believed in five interglacial periods, a great gulf
intervened. Perfectly aware of his apparent isolation,
and supremely confident in the accuracy of his results,
James Geikie pressed strongly on his readers the
necessity of appreciating more fully the significance
of the facts, and in consequence his book became very
obviously an argument in favour of Pleistocene and
Recent oscillations of climate rather than a critical and
impartial review of the evidence available. In every
case he went as far in support of his conclusions as
the facts in his opinion could be interpreted to lead;
and the treatment of British glacial questions showed
undoubtedly a stubborn courage and a determination
to make the best of his case, which only his confidence
in the general sufficiency of the evidence for
the whole of Europe could be held to justify.</p>

<p>In foreign countries generally he found more
support, though everywhere, it may be admitted,
his views must have been regarded as extreme. In
Germany glacial investigation was still in a comparatively
backward state, but in Penck, Brückner,
and Partsch (names subsequently to figure most
prominently in the story of the advance of this
department of science) he found disciples and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
supporters of the highest value. The investigations
of these geologists had led them independently
to the belief in the repeated glaciation of the Alps and
the mountains of Central and Eastern Europe. Their
chief results were still to appear, but enough was
known of their conclusions to define their attitude.
In Norway and Sweden, though many notable
investigations into glacial geology had been made,
no general consensus of opinion had been reached
as to the stages into which the glacial history of that
country must be subdivided, and <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie still
found his old friend Axel Blytt the nearest in
agreement with his views among the Scandinavian
geologists. In France the existence of interglacial
periods had warm defenders and keen opponents;
but attention was being directed more particularly
to the successive phases of palæolithic culture, in
the study of which French geologists and anthropologists
have always been in the forefront. But in
America a school of geologists had arisen in which
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> James Geikie had found not only warm personal
friends but also powerful supporters in his theoretical
views, and a most notable contribution to the third
edition of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite> are the chapters by
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Chamberlin (<i><abbr title="compare">cf.</abbr></i> Part <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, <a href="#Page_120" title="Page 120"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 120</a>), in which the
glacial history of North America is reviewed. The
literature of the glacial geology of that continent has
now swelled to enormous dimensions, and to describe
the phenomena in a critical and discriminative
manner was beyond the powers of anyone who had
not devoted many years to a personal examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
of the evidence; but in <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Chamberlin an
exponent was secured who was not only in very
substantial agreement with <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie in his conclusions,
but was also exceptionally familiar with the
facts.</p>

<p>The general reception of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s book
was deferential if not enthusiastic. The masterly
handling of the subject was freely admitted, and
the thorough and scholarly manner in which the
sources of information had been searched; but no
symptoms appeared to indicate the existence of
a school of advanced interglacialists, in Britain
at any rate, prepared to accept and defend the
author’s theoretical views. In fact, for a time it
almost seemed as if the belief in the reality of interglacial
periods, or at least in their importance, was
less prevalent than it had been fifteen years before.
A very large body of geologists declined to regard
the evidence on which <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie and his supporters
relied as having real value or significance. There
were still a few supporters of the theory of the
marine origin of boulder-clay, and even some who
were prepared to advocate the agency of floods and
debacles as the prime factors in the formation of
boulder-clay; and their views for some years were
prominent in the discussion of the origin of glacial
deposits. The majority of experienced geologists
certainly did not accept these explanations; but they
were equally unwilling to concede that the Ice Age
could be subdivided into six glacial epochs, alternating
with warmer climates in which Northern Europe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
America had been occupied by a fauna and flora
of temperate facies.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie lived to see very considerable
changes in the opinion of geologists on these
matters. As time went on much new evidence
accumulated to prove that great fluctuations of climate
had marked the recent stages of the earth’s history.
From many sides facts were reported which tended
to support his theories. Gradually it came to be
recognised that the ice margin must have withdrawn
at times for considerable distances, leaving bare wide
tracts of country which became populated by animals
and plants. Still, however, it was contended that
these were mere episodes of no great account,
temporary retreats and advances of the ice-sheets,
unworthy to be designated glacial and interglacial
periods. But the increase of knowledge renders this
position less and less tenable as years go by, and
it may fairly be claimed that before <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s
death, in most countries of Europe and North
America the existence of several interglacial periods
was freely conceded by a majority of those who
were competent to express an opinion on the
subject.</p>

<p>The important new evidence brought to light was
not wholly the result of geological investigation,
though much of it was strictly of the kind to which
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie had appealed. Most striking perhaps
were the descriptions of the glacial phenomena of the
Alpine valleys which Profs. Penck and Brückner
published in a famous volume in 1909. This work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
was most appropriately dedicated by the authors to
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> James Geikie. It is probably the most notable
contribution to the literature of glacial geology in the
last twenty years, and although it has not escaped
criticism, it has produced in the minds of impartial
readers a firm conviction of the occurrence of glacial
and interglacial periods so far as that part of Europe
is concerned. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie was familiar with some of
the evidence from the Alpine chain when he was
writing the third edition of <cite>The Great Ice Age</cite>; some
of the facts had led geologists to postulate the
existence of interglacial periods as long ago as the
middle of last century; but he watched with great
pleasure the gradual accumulation of observations
added to previous knowledge by Penck and Brückner,
and for many years he maintained an active correspondence
with these investigators. In America, also,
the opinion was gradually gaining strength that the
Ice Age was marked by several prolonged intervals of
warmer conditions; and in France, Germany, and
Scandinavia many geologists were added to the ranks
of those who maintained the importance of interglacial
periods.</p>

<p>Hardly less convincing than the results of Penck
and Brückner’s investigations into the repeated
glaciation of the Alps were the advances which have
been made by the study of palæolithic deposits,
especially in France, Belgium, and Germany, during
the last twenty years. In popular interest this
chapter of geological history necessarily surpasses all
others, and the study of the deposits of the caverns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
and river valleys which contain the rude stone weapons
of early man and the remains of the wild animals
which he hunted has never lacked enthusiastic
investigators. In particular, the geologists and
anthropologists of France have distinguished themselves
by their patience and success in this department;
and the palæolithic history of Europe is now far more
fully known than it was in 1895. These investigations
have shown not only that man inhabited
Northern Europe before the cold conditions of the
glacial period had passed away, as <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie had
stoutly maintained from an early period in his career,
but also that cold epochs had alternated repeatedly
with warmer epochs. Differences of opinion, of
course, there are, as is inevitable in subjects which
at the present time have been so incompletely
examined. Penck and Geikie, for example, would
place the epoch of weapons of Acheulian type in the
second interglacial warm period, while Boule and
Schmidt would relegate it to the third; but the
significant fact remains that there is a general
agreement that since man inhabited Northern Europe
he has seen repeated epochs of genial climate
alternating with periods of severe cold.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie was always deeply interested in this
work, and followed the course of investigation with
the closest attention. Unfortunately Scotland possesses
no deposits containing palæolithic weapons;
and circumstances precluded him from taking part
in the field studies except during brief holiday visits
to the Continent; but he diligently read the literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
as may be seen in his course of Munro lectures in
Edinburgh University in 1913, subsequently published
in book form as <cite>The Antiquity of Man in Europe</cite>.
In reading this book, it is pleasant to find how little
change he had been obliged to make in the conclusions
he had arrived at twenty years before, and
how fully his sagacious interpretation of the evidence
then available had stood the test of time. One can
notice in his preface a serene conviction that his
work had been justified by the results.</p>

<p>“The research of the past twenty years has certainly
cleared up much that was doubtful and obscure, and
brought to light many interesting details which
enable us to form a more adequate conception of the
early history of our race than was previously possible.
These later investigations, however, have not in any
respect shaken the general conclusions arrived at
twenty years ago but, on the contrary, have served
only to strengthen and confirm them.”</p>

<p>Gradually also the difficult task of correlating
the interglacial deposits of Britain, Switzerland, and
France was being mastered, and even the interglacial
periods of North America were being relegated with
more or less confidence to their proper places with
reference to the European sequence, so that in this,
his last book, he was able to announce that solid
progress had been made along the lines of advance
which he had sketched, and his laborious investigations
had produced valuable results.</p>

<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie had always considered that much
valuable knowledge of the climatic changes which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Scotland had undergone since the melting of the
great ice-sheet would be obtained from a minute
examination of the peat-bogs which cover large
expanses both of the hills and of the plains of his
native country. His own botanical training was
insufficient to enable him to attack such a problem
with success, but for many years he closely studied
the geology of the peat-bogs, and never failed to
impress on his students that a rich harvest of
scientific information might be reaped by any
investigator who took this difficult task in hand.
Fortunately he lived to see a very careful examination
of the flora of the Scottish peat-bogs by <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Lewis
published in four parts in <cite>The Transactions of the
Royal Society of Edinburgh</cite>. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Lewis was
evidently much indebted to <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie and to
Dr Horne for suggestions and assistance in the
geological part of his work; but the evidence, which
is very carefully and fully stated in his papers, is
sufficient to carry conviction on several important
points. He shows that many of the peat mosses
began their growth under arctic conditions when
glaciers must have existed in many of the more
elevated districts of Britain. Thereafter changes
of climate supervened, and were accompanied by
changes in the flora, of which the remains are now
preserved in successive layers of peat. Speaking
generally, we may say that the lowest arctic plant
bed is followed by a lower forest bed, usually rich in
birch (and sometimes hazel and alder), which is
overlain by a second arctic bed, followed in turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
by a second or upper forest bed containing mostly
roots and stools of pine. Above these lies the modern
peat. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Lewis concluded as the result of his
researches that while it is difficult to reconcile the
several stages in the peat with the theory of a single
glaciation, the whole of the peat beds agree very
closely with the scheme of classification proposed by
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie (in the third edition of <cite>The Great Ice
Age</cite> published thirteen years before). These results
were none the less gratifying because they had been
in some measure foreseen; and if we admit, as some
maintain, that the final test of scientific hypothesis is
the power to foresee the outcome of future researches,
we must agree that <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie had good reason to
feel that his speculations on late-glacial changes in
climate in Britain had not been mistaken.</p>

<p>When in course of time the third edition of <cite>The
Great Ice Age</cite> was sold out, he considered very
carefully whether he should undertake a revision of
the book, bringing it up to date by incorporation of
the most recent additions to our knowledge of the
glacial period. Advancing years made him to some
extent reluctant to undertake so formidable a task, and
he felt also that in his interpretation of the chief events
of this chapter of geological history he had no radical
alterations to make. This, as we have already said,
is sufficiently clear from his attitude in his Munro
lectures. Moreover, the whole subject was highly
controversial, and he greatly disliked fighting the
old battles over again. At one time he was seriously
thinking of writing a short work outlining the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
important recent advances in glacial geology, but the
intention was never carried into effect.</p>

<p>Problems of tectonics and of the relations between
geological structure and the surface configuration
of the earth at the present time always possessed a
strong fascination for him, and in his college lectures
were favourite topics for discussion. Belonging to
both geology and geography, these were subjects in
which all his powers found congenial exercise. The
<cite>Scottish Geographical Magazine</cite> contains many papers
from his pen dealing with physical geology, and the
last of these which he wrote was on “The Deeps of
the Pacific Ocean and their Origin.” In this paper
he advocated a new interpretation of these great
submarine depressions, and as his views were not
in accordance with those of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Suess of Vienna,
as expounded in his great work <cite>The Face of the
Earth</cite>, this paper was the occasion of a long and
friendly correspondence with the eminent Austrian
geologist (an Englishman by birth). <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie
had always been a great admirer of Suess and a
close student of his writings, and both were attracted
by the same kind of problems. In 1911 <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie
had written a paper on the “Architecture and Origin
of the Alps” which appeared in the <cite>Scottish Geographical
Magazine</cite>, and ten years previously more
than one paper on the origin and structure of
mountains had been contributed by him to various
journals. He now determined to use the materials
he had collected for the preparation of a book which
was ultimately issued under the title<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> <cite>Mountains:
their Origin, Growth, and Decay</cite>. As usual he did
not despise the non-scientific reader, but made his
exposition of the subject so simple and clear that all
could apprehend his meaning. A vast amount of
important work had been done on the geological
structure of the Alps during the previous ten years,
and in addition to reading the literature carefully, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
Geikie visited Switzerland to make himself familiar
with the scenes he described, and to enable him to
form an opinion on the theories advanced, based on
personal examination of some of the best sections.
At the same time he utilised the results of the work of
his old colleagues of the Scottish Survey on the North-west
Highlands, where they had gleaned new data of
the highest value, and the book was illustrated with
many beautiful photographs of Scottish and Alpine
mountains. Throughout the book the influence
of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Suess is often noticeable. The compilation
of this book was a thoroughly congenial task
to <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie. He was content for a time to
let glacial controversies rest, and to concentrate his
attention on problems of geographical evolution.</p>

<p>In bringing to a close this short review of
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s scientific work, we may be permitted
to point out what seems to be the main characteristics
of his investigation and teaching. Had he
been questioned himself on this point, there can be
no doubt he would have given his University courses
of instruction a high place in his services to science.
He never allowed himself to regard it as routine
work, to be hurried through without enthusiasm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
He gave his best to his students, and constantly
improved his lectures, excursions, and practical
classes, so as to make them as modern and as
complete as circumstances would allow. Hampered
by very inadequate accommodation and equipment,
he gave freely of his time and money to compensate
for these disadvantages. The ordinary student he
strove to interest and to instruct, and as year by
year his classes increased, he had good evidence
to convince him that both his subject and his method
of expounding it were receiving their full share of
attention among the students of the University.
But he had a keen eye for merit, and young men
who evinced a desire to pursue the path of original
research were quickly recognised and encouraged
in every way to follow the right lines. Thus, although
geology was for a long time a very small class, it
produced almost every year one or more men who
subsequently made a name for themselves in science.
All over the world, and especially in the British
colonies, there are many well-known geologists who
can trace the impetus which decided their careers to
the lectures delivered by the genial professor in the
dingy old Edinburgh class-room at the top of those
interminable stairs.</p>

<p>As a geologist he had limitations which he
clearly recognised. Palæontology, petrology, and
mineralogy he had a sound working knowledge of,
but he never professed to know them thoroughly,
and much of the teaching of these subjects he left
to specially trained assistants. Had he been better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
equipped in these respects, he might have avoided
some of the pitfalls into which he stumbled at times.
But in physical and structural geology he took a
very high place among living scientists. The
thorough training and natural aptitude for structural
and field geology made him a very shrewd judge
of controversial questions in tectonics, and laid a
secure foundation for his researches in geographical
evolution and the origin of the earth’s surface
features. As a geographer, interested especially in
the larger problems of geographical configuration, he
earned a world-wide reputation. His special field
of work, however, was the history of the glacial
period in all its aspects, and as time went on he
came to be recognised as the most thorough-going
advocate of repeated glacial and interglacial epochs.
The positions he took up at a very early stage in
his scientific career he maintained with little modification
till its close, and in spite of indifference and in
the face of severe criticism he saw his theories more
and more completely established year by year.
The subject is one of the most controversial in
geological science at the present day. Very eminent
authorities may be found who deny the validity of
nearly every one of <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Geikie’s conclusions about
interglacial epochs, but there is a large and increasing
body of supporters of his views, though even now
the extreme position he took up in subdividing the
Ice Age into six glacial periods cannot be said to
be generally accepted. But if we compare the text-books
of the present day with those published twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
years ago, we can realise how great an advance has
been made in the direction in which he led; and there
can be no doubt that in the long-run his consistency,
courage, and sagacity will receive full recognition.</p>

<p>The old Scottish school of geology which had
numbered so many famous men among its members
found in James Geikie one of its most distinguished
representatives. In science, as in all things, he was
pre-eminently a Scotsman. Ramsay and Croll, two
of the most philosophic geologists of their time, were
the men to whom he owed the inspiration which
originally directed him, and he was a true disciple
of Playfair, whose memory he reverenced. In all
his writings he places in the foreground the observations
which he and his fellow-workers in Scotland
had made in the field, and the inferences drawn from
them; and it was in no small measure to James Geikie
that the high position which the work of Scottish
geologists holds in the estimation of scientific men
is to be ascribed.</p>

<p>In the “List of Publications” missing quotation marks have been added, but other inconsistent punctuation has not been changed.</p>
<p>In the index the spelling of Moncrieffe (from Moncrieff) and Skjervö (from Skerjvö) have been changed
to match the spelling in the main text.</p>
<p>On <a href="#Page_123" title="Page 123">page 123</a> the signature copied as “Dr Hav. Pfeifer” appears to be that of the glacialist Dr Franz Xaver Pfeifer.
The signature also appears in this form in <cite>The Journal of Geology</cite>.</p>
